1,t3_9v7n53,lioness0,"My eldest did this. It started with her doing it against the cot rails, then the wall and eventually the floor. We just had to let the phase pass. 

We used to pick her up and sit her on our lap and usually had to put our arms across her shoulders/chest as she would continue to head bang our chests otherwise. We did get bitten quite a few times for holding her like that but honestly couldn't think of a better way to prevent her hurting herself. 

Once the frustration had passed we put her down and told her ""no banging heads""

I think she did it for about 3/4 month. It's hard at that age to teach them not to do certain things as they don't understand what or why they are doing it. My daughter was just a hot head like her mum. 

Sorry this isn't helpful on how to get the head banging to stop but your not on your own with this one. ",5,"My 15 month old daughter has started banging her head on the ground.

2,t3_9v7n53,babymommao,"My toddler is juuuust about past this phase now. I put it down to his speech, he now shouts at the top of his lungs! (Better than crazy headbanging though!) 

It really used to make me cringe and there were times where he’d obviously taken it too far and hurt himself. Like you said, it’s pure frustration. 

We have a little porch area in our house where I’ll send toddler to calm down. Its 100% not a punishment but purely a space to calm down and gather himself. If he’s having a tantrum I’ll take him to the porch and explain that I know he is sad/upset/angry but *insert reason here*. It’s okay for kids to get angry but it’s trying to channel it somewhere rather than the headbutts!

14,t3_6a3m3j,dedicednu,"You can absolutely contact your local Early Intervention organization if you have any concerns. They may need a doctor referral, but mine didn't. I had considered contacting them due to delayed language but the youngest age they seem to evaluate was 18 months and my son was about 16.

He's 16 months old and I started worrying since he missed the milestones for pointing, waving; he doesn't even kiss. He's still not saying a single word (although he does babble with variations in tonality, like if he's speaking in a foreign language). If he needs things, he would grab my hand, and take me to whatever he needs (kitchen if he's hungry, living room for TV, and his room for play). But he would never point at what he needs. 
 
I know he understands what I'm saying, and I know it's not a hearing issue, since when I'm singing to him, I have his full attention. 

He's not very social around other kids, he doesn't seem to be interested in interacting with them, although he's been attending daycare since he was 3 months old. 
Strangely he's not afraid or shy of adults, and would smile to strangers, and sometimes interact and play with them. My pediatrician used this argument to dismiss all my fears, saying if he's interacting with adults, then maybe he's just not ready to play with other kids yet. 

If I call his name, he wouldn't instantly turn his head and look at me. He would selectively do so, depending on whether he's preoccupied with something else. I would repeat his name constantly and he would also choose not to look back at me. 

Otherwise he's not showing typical signs of Autism, like flapping hands, or spinning, or banging head, or walking on toes. He doesn't seem to have an ""organized"" way of playing with toys. He's not withdrawn and doesn't show  other red flags of autism. 

My pediatrician thinks I'm spending too much time browsing the internet, and I should give my son a break. 
Parents, I need your help, am I being a helicopter mom, or are my fears valid. 
If so, who should be able to take a look into this? A pediatric neurologist? or a pediatric psychologist?  Obviously my pediatrician is not a good candidate. 
Should I test him now? Or should I wait till his a bit older?

EDIT: Thank you all for the support! This is an amazing community.

I want to share with you something amazing that happened yesterday.  For the last few weeks I've been focusing on teaching my son how to wave, clap and point without any success. Yesterday I brought him really close to a monkey sticker on the wall and asked him where is the monkey. He took his hand and put it on the monkey sticker. 
I know it's not exactly an achievement for his age, but for us it's a big milestone. 

We still did not see any claps or waving, and I think flying kisses are too much to ask for at this point. But we're getting somewhere. It might be that no one is teaching him this stuff after all.  

Thanks for the parents who validated my concerns. And while the rational side of me wants to dismiss all my fears (and I thank the people who brought that to my attention), I am not going to wait. I'll just approach this differently with his pediatrician. 

Instead of discussing gut feelings, I will bring out the facts. On his 17 months checkup, coming up in few weeks, I'll just prepare the list of unaccomplished development milestones for his age, and discuss them with the pediatrician and see what she has to say about it. 

Thanks again everyone. Unfortunately the issue of Autism is not easy to bring out with people, especially family. So you are my only support group, and I can't thank you enough.

So many people nowadays WANT to have something wrong with them, and its now projecting on their children.

I want to share with you something amazing that happened yesterday.  For the last few weeks I've been focusing on teaching my son how to wave, clap and point without any success. Yesterday I brought him really close to a monkey sticker on the wall and asked him where is the monkey. He took his hand and put it on the monkey sticker. 
I know it's not exactly an achievement for his age, but for us it's a big milestone. 

We still did not see any claps or waving, and I think flying kisses are too much to ask for at this point. But we're getting somewhere. It might be that no one is teaching him this stuff after all.  

Thanks for the parents who validated my concerns. And while the rational side of me wants to dismiss all my fears (and I thank the people who brought that to my attention), I am not going to wait. I'll just approach this differently with his pediatrician. 

Instead of discussing gut feelings, I will bring out the facts. On his 17 months checkup, coming up in few weeks, I'll just prepare the list of unaccomplished development milestones for his age, and discuss them with the pediatrician and see what she has to say about it. 

Thanks again everyone. Unfortunately the issue of Autism is not easy to bring out with people, especially family. So you are my only support group, and I can't thank you enough.

19,t3_6a3m3j,eurekahd,"Are you in the US? Our pediatrician follows American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines that state routine autism screening should be performed at 18 and 24 months. She uses the M-CHAT-R, which is a simple checklist for parents to complete and then go over the results with the doctor.

I believe it's valid beginning at 16 months, so you could do the checklist on your own and then ask your pediatrician to go through the results with you. It's one of the tools recommended by AAP, so she's hopefully at least heard of it.

He's 16 months old and I started worrying since he missed the milestones for pointing, waving; he doesn't even kiss. He's still not saying a single word (although he does babble with variations in tonality, like if he's speaking in a foreign language). If he needs things, he would grab my hand, and take me to whatever he needs (kitchen if he's hungry, living room for TV, and his room for play). But he would never point at what he needs. 
 
I know he understands what I'm saying, and I know it's not a hearing issue, since when I'm singing to him, I have his full attention. 

He's not very social around other kids, he doesn't seem to be interested in interacting with them, although he's been attending daycare since he was 3 months old. 
Strangely he's not afraid or shy of adults, and would smile to strangers, and sometimes interact and play with them. My pediatrician used this argument to dismiss all my fears, saying if he's interacting with adults, then maybe he's just not ready to play with other kids yet. 

If I call his name, he wouldn't instantly turn his head and look at me. He would selectively do so, depending on whether he's preoccupied with something else. I would repeat his name constantly and he would also choose not to look back at me.

23,t3_6a3m3j,scurvyqueen,"If you are in the US, there is no reason that you should not have your son tested by Early Intervention.  The first warning sign for my son was that he was not pointing or waving at 12 months, and with only that information our pediatrician recommended EI as a first step.  In our case, the wait time for EI was a few weeks while the wait time to see a pediatric psychologist was six months.  Early Intervention will evaluate your son to see if he is age appropriate and they will get you help if you need it.  They WON'T give you a diagnosis, but they will tell you what the areas of concern are.  Armed with that info, you can talk to your pediatrician about a referral.  For us, our first step was a pediatric neurologist, who then referred us to several other specialists.  

My son was tested for autism twice.  The first time he was just over 3, and the tester used the fact that he was engaging with adults to say he was not on the spectrum.  He was tested again by a different doctor at three and a half, and she said that a little known sign of autism is a disinterest in peers, but an affinity for adults.  By that point, my son has other deficits, and was given a diagnosis.  

There is no bad outcome to seeing Early Intervention - either he needs extra help and he will get it, or he doesn't need extra help and you can feel reassured.  Best of luck.",2,"Dear parents, I'd appreciate help from those who've been there.

He used over 100 words at the milestone when he had to know 10, but he was a little behind with potty training and feeding himself, and could be quite moody, he is catching up now at 3.5 and well adjusted. My younger guy is average at speech at best, but he's a sneaky smart quiet guy and very observant. He loves to feed himself with utensils way before anyone expected. Your little man is really young, give it time, they pick things up at their own pace.

Also, if google was right every time I looked something up. I'd most likely be dead of cancer by now.

Otherwise he's not showing typical signs of Autism, like flapping hands, or spinning, or banging head, or walking on toes. He doesn't seem to have an ""organized"" way of playing with toys. He's not withdrawn and doesn't show  other red flags of autism. 

My pediatrician thinks I'm spending too much time browsing the internet, and I should give my son a break. 
Parents, I need your help, am I being a helicopter mom, or are my fears valid. 
If so, who should be able to take a look into this? A pediatric neurologist? or a pediatric psychologist?  Obviously my pediatrician is not a good candidate. 
Should I test him now? Or should I wait till his a bit older?

Thanks a lot for your help, and sorry for the long post. 


EDIT: Thank you all for the support! This is an amazing community.

I want to share with you something amazing that happened yesterday.  For the last few weeks I've been focusing on teaching my son how to wave, clap and point without any success. Yesterday I brought him really close to a monkey sticker on the wall and asked him where is the monkey. He took his hand and put it on the monkey sticker. 
I know it's not exactly an achievement for his age, but for us it's a big milestone. 

We still did not see any claps or waving, and I think flying kisses are too much to ask for at this point. But we're getting somewhere. It might be that no one is teaching him this stuff after all.  

Thanks for the parents who validated my concerns. And while the rational side of me wants to dismiss all my fears (and I thank the people who brought that to my attention), I am not going to wait. I'll just approach this differently with his pediatrician. 

Instead of discussing gut feelings, I will bring out the facts. On his 17 months checkup, coming up in few weeks, I'll just prepare the list of unaccomplished development milestones for his age, and discuss them with the pediatrician and see what she has to say about it. 

Thanks again everyone. Unfortunately the issue of Autism is not easy to bring out with people, especially family. So you are my only support group, and I can't thank you enough.

I agree. 

However, if your gut is telling you something is wrong, get a second opinion. They really don't diagnose autism at 16 months, but they can identify where your son is in terms of development, and give you things to work on/watch out for. Hopefully getting a second opinion will just calm your nerves either way. 

That said, if it helps, your son sounds like a completely typical 16 month old. The range that kids start saying their first words varies WILDLY. Some kids will start saying their first words at 8 months old. Others, not until 18 months old or even later. Same with walking. 

Also, toddlers DO ignore people. Your son might just be ignoring you when you call his name because he doesn't care to respond. Toddlers are assholes like that. 

16 month olds rarely interact with other children, especially if they don't have siblings. Its not until around 3 that they even usually play with other kids, until then the most you can really expect is parallel play. ",2,"Dear parents, I'd appreciate help from those who've been there. 

He's 16 months old and I started worrying since he missed the milestones for pointing, waving; he doesn't even kiss. He's still not saying a single word (although he does babble with variations in tonality, like if he's speaking in a foreign language). If he needs things, he would grab my hand, and take me to whatever he needs (kitchen if he's hungry, living room for TV, and his room for play). But he would never point at what he needs. 
 
I know he understands what I'm saying, and I know it's not a hearing issue, since when I'm singing to him, I have his full attention. 

He's not very social around other kids, he doesn't seem to be interested in interacting with them, although he's been attending daycare since he was 3 months old.

28,t3_6a3m3j,pcbzelephant,"He's only 16 months old, I wouldn't worry at all! As far as not pointing, waving or kissing do you regularly do these things in front of him? If not this may be why he doesn't do them. With my daughter she wouldn't nod her head yes or no because I never did it. Once I did she started doing it about a week later. So try to point, wave and kiss a ton and hopefully he will copy you eventually. Also my daughter is almost 2 and is just now starting to play with other kids and talk a lot! At 16 months she enjoyed playing by herself and only said very few words. Give him time.

29,t3_6a3m3j,ReinierPersoon,"You might want to ask this at /r/autism as well. Perhaps ask how they went about getting a diagnosis.

Autism is a spectrum and a syndrome: not everyone displays all the possible symptoms. I don't think the flapping hands or headbanging are all that common.

35,t3_6a3m3j,sbrib,"Thank you for sharing. 

Yes we definitely do not have eye contact problems. Interaction is fine as far as adults go. With children it's much more complicated. He does notice them, but usually only to steal the ball from them and then go play on his own. 

I was just worried about the combination of not waving, not pointing and speech delay. Had it been only speech delay, I wouldn't have thought about it at all. My sister was speech delayed she only talked after 2. She's fine now.


",2,"Dear parents, I'd appreciate help from those who've been there. 

He's 16 months old and I started worrying since he missed the milestones for pointing, waving; he doesn't even kiss. He's still not saying a single word (although he does babble with variations in tonality, like if he's speaking in a foreign language). If he needs things, he would grab my hand, and take me to whatever he needs (kitchen if he's hungry, living room for TV, and his room for play). But he would never point at what he needs. 
 
I know he understands what I'm saying, and I know it's not a hearing issue, since when I'm singing to him, I have his full attention. 

He's not very social around other kids, he doesn't seem to be interested in interacting with them, although he's been attending daycare since he was 3 months old. 
Strangely he's not afraid or shy of adults, and would smile to strangers, and sometimes interact and play with them. My pediatrician used this argument to dismiss all my fears, saying if he's interacting with adults, then maybe he's just not ready to play with other kids yet. 

If I call his name, he wouldn't instantly turn his head and look at me. He would selectively do so, depending on whether he's preoccupied with something else. I would repeat his name constantly and he would also choose not to look back at me. 

Otherwise he's not showing typical signs of Autism, like flapping hands, or spinning, or banging head, or walking on toes. He doesn't seem to have an ""organized"" way of playing with toys. He's not withdrawn and doesn't show  other red flags of autism. 

My pediatrician thinks I'm spending too much time browsing the internet, and I should give my son a break. 
Parents, I need your help, am I being a helicopter mom, or are my fears valid. 
If so, who should be able to take a look into this? A pediatric neurologist? or a pediatric psychologist?  Obviously my pediatrician is not a good candidate.

Parents, I need your help, am I being a helicopter mom, or are my fears valid. 
If so, who should be able to take a look into this? A pediatric neurologist? or a pediatric psychologist?  Obviously my pediatrician is not a good candidate. 
Should I test him now? Or should I wait till his a bit older?

Thanks a lot for your help, and sorry for the long post. 


EDIT: Thank you all for the support! This is an amazing community.

I want to share with you something amazing that happened yesterday.  For the last few weeks I've been focusing on teaching my son how to wave, clap and point without any success. Yesterday I brought him really close to a monkey sticker on the wall and asked him where is the monkey. He took his hand and put it on the monkey sticker. 
I know it's not exactly an achievement for his age, but for us it's a big milestone. 

We still did not see any claps or waving, and I think flying kisses are too much to ask for at this point. But we're getting somewhere. It might be that no one is teaching him this stuff after all.  

Thanks for the parents who validated my concerns. And while the rational side of me wants to dismiss all my fears (and I thank the people who brought that to my attention), I am not going to wait. I'll just approach this differently with his pediatrician. 

Instead of discussing gut feelings, I will bring out the facts. On his 17 months checkup, coming up in few weeks, I'll just prepare the list of unaccomplished development milestones for his age, and discuss them with the pediatrician and see what she has to say about it. 

Thanks again everyone. Unfortunately the issue of Autism is not easy to bring out with people, especially family. So you are my only support group, and I can't thank you enough.

44,t3_6a3m3j,I_cannot_poofread,">I was just worried about the combination of not waving, not pointing and speech delay. 


Sit back and think about this.  How many adults do you see waving and pointing during a typical day?  I have waved at someone maybe once this week and that was to a neighbor as she drove by.  Usually my hands are full and I nod my head when neighbors pass. Waving doesn't really have that big of a place in communication in day to day interactions.  

What's so great about pointing?  Well it can be used to show someone what you want.  But he does that, he takes you to exactly what he wants (which is a lot more effective then pointing, I have trouble telling what my older kids are pointing at).  

My eldest didn't clap until he was close to 2.  We were never in a situation where clapping was the norm.  

With waving and pointing it isn't the action itself that is important it is the intention (social interaction and communication).  

>He does notice them, but usually only to steal the ball from them and then go play on his own.

Children his age don't play with other children.  They notice them and then go play on their own.  Eventually they will parallel play where they do similar activities next to another child but still not playing with them.


",10,"Dear parents, I'd appreciate help from those who've been there. 

He's 16 months old and I started worrying since he missed the milestones for pointing, waving; he doesn't even kiss. He's still not saying a single word (although he does babble with variations in tonality, like if he's speaking in a foreign language). If he needs things, he would grab my hand, and take me to whatever he needs (kitchen if he's hungry, living room for TV, and his room for play). But he would never point at what he needs. 
 
I know he understands what I'm saying, and I know it's not a hearing issue, since when I'm singing to him, I have his full attention.

47,t3_6a3m3j,Kovis,"No, most pediatricians won't do anything until at least 16 months. Anything before that is pretty much a waste of money. They still have leaps to go through.

Every kid learns at different rates and do things at different times. Our son was a little late to the talking game, but he was walking very early, he pretty much skipped crawling and went straight to walking and a few weeks later he was crawling up on the couch and he barely 9 months old. The pediatrician said that sometimes they concentrate on one thing and learn it. In my son's case, he really wanted to walk and do things and that was more important than talking. He's still doing things that other kids can't his age, but isn't talking much.",3,"Dear parents, I'd appreciate help from those who've been there.

48,t3_6864qt,Roupert2,What is her sleep schedule? Waking up unhappy sounds like a sign of being overtired. If she's chronically overtired it could be what is making her so moody and irritable. ,7,"Hello all,

Writing for advice about my 15 month old daughter.  She's our second child, her sister is 5 years old.

Since she was born it was very clear that she wasn't going to be as laid back and innocent as our older daughter, and that was to be expected(since our first daughter was ridiculously easy to care for).  

As the younger daughter grew up my wife and I were very conscious of some very slight things she did that we didn't think were normal.  Banging head head against the wall(lightly), more severe tantrums than we were used to seeing, not attaching herself to any real toys or even showing a remote slight interest in the TV or watching photos or movies on our phone in situations where we are trying to keep her calm.  The big item we noticed though was that she had absolutely no interest in any sort of cuddling or hugs or any affection of any kind.  As soon as she was strong enough to hold herself up, she would most times literally push us away.  It sucked, but we just figured it was the difference between two kids.  I would guess that the longest she has allowed me or my wife to hold her ""like a baby"" since she was about 4 weeks old is maybe 15 seconds.  This hurts from a selfish parenting perspective, but this also makes it to where we basically can't take her to restaurants or most public places because she won't sit in our laps or be entertained for anymore than 5-10 minutes.

With all of this said, she seems to be developing fairly normally.  She knows 20-25 words, some sign language, understands several commands and generally seems eager to please when she is in a good mood.  There within lies the problem, she seems perpetually unhappy.

She wakes up in a bad mood, often times crying/whining until we find whatever random variation of eating/standing that she wants.  We take her to day care and she fights us to get into the car.  When we pick her up, she seems to enjoy day care and seems happy to see us, but then she fights us to go back home.  We chalked this up to some kind of separation anxiety...maybe she doesn't want to leave us in the morning...then adjusts....then doesn't want to leave them in the afternoons?

When we get home, I would guess out of the 2 hours we get to play with her she spends AT LEAST 50% of it unhappy.  Some of it uncontrollable crying, some of it just heavy whining.  If we tell her no or stop her from doing something stupid, she goes into complete meltdown mode every time with no real pattern of how long she will be upset.  Most of the time she hates taking baths, she doesn't seem particularly interested in any of the hundreds of toys our first daughter accumulated(the toys she does use often times are things like forks or inanimate objects).  It's literally a fight almost every night until bed time.  On the weekends, it's basically the same except for longer periods of time, so it's clearly not just her being tired(although that could be some of it during the week).

My wife and I have done our best to try and just pass this off as having a child that is a little more stubborn than most.  We are both home, virtually the entire time after work, everyday.  We actively play with her, and her sister absolutely adores her and tries to play with her too.  The majority of the time we reset and keep positive attitudes around her, but it seems to sometimes only be getting worse.  

We spoke to our doctor at our 1 year checkup and he didn't seem too concerned.  At the time, we noticed she had a lot of runny noses and stuff so we thought maybe she had bad allergies and it was causing her a level of discomfort.  We tried allergy medicine for a few weeks and it didn't change anything.

It should be noted that when she IS in a good mood, she's a really awesome fun kid.  She communicates well, she is really really mobile and is fun.  When we go to other peoples houses she often seems more entertained and acts better.  Maybe she's just bored of our house?  But to THIS level?

Anyway.  I don't even really know what I'm looking for answer wise.  Maybe someone has had similar experiences.  I obviously feel like there are some behavioral type issues we might need to lookout for down the road, but it's not like it's something they can(nor do I likely want) her to be doing at this young age.  

For the longest time my wife and I kept telling ourselves that we weren't being patient enough or we were spoiled because of our first kid, but it's becoming far more worrisome now.  We are having to spend so much time and energy keeping the younger child happy that we aren't spending as much time with our 5 year old.  

Thanks for reading.  Any help would be wonderful. :)
 

"
49,t3_6864qt,whosparentingwhom,"She sounds like my older daughter in a lot of ways. She's 4 now and for her it is just her personality. She's very strong-willed, sensitive, has difficulty transitioning from one activity to the next. 

What you said about not wanting to go to daycare and then not wanting to leave to go home really rang true. Also the part about waking up in a bad mood constantly...that lasted till she was around 2. There was a period of time when she was about 2-2.5 that we literally had to stop taking her to the park because no matter how long we stayed she wouldn't leave without being dragged away kicking and screaming. 

Sigh...kids are tough. Bring up your concerns at your 18 month appt again. Some things that worked with our daughter: we used tons of if/then statements or first/then, ""first bib, then dinner"" etc. Also giving choices as much as possible so she had some control over her situation. For example, ""either hold hands or you can ride in the stroller"" then if she argues just keep repeating ""hands or stroller?""

50,t3_6864qt,SmittenPeony,"I think I'd side with the majority of the comments here - it sounds like a difference in temperaments.

I kept thinking that I was ""doing something wrong"" or that there was something wrong with my son (he's now two). To simplify things greatly, it appeared to me that all of my friend's babies were happy most of the time... but mine wasn't. (A lot of what you say is the same for my son).

And while I knew it in my head, the truth of the statement ""all kids are different"" didn't sink in practically I guess. Some kids are content and will be successful in life and work hard and won't need very much parental input at all. Others suck their parents dry and still need more attention/affection/direction/whatever. 

From one parent who feels they've had the life sucked out of them to another, good luck :) I've found the need for my 100% focused attention has declined literally in the past month (i.e. as he approached 2 years of age). But I still need to take him out of the house twice a day to keep him stimulated - otherwise, when he gets bored, he gets ANGRY. He's okay with toys for a limited amount of time but it really is the outings that keep him happy.  If I were you, I'd try to find small groups she could attend. We go to a music group, gymnastics, the library and a church toddler's group. Then I go to parks in the afternoon. 

My mum said I needed constant stimulation as a baby. My mother-in-law has said that all her kids needed more stimulation that all her friends' babies. Both my husband, his siblings and I have been identified as ""gifted"" learners. So maybe your daughter really is just that bored at home??

Hope this helps!

P.S. my niece is diagnosed with autism - it has different symptoms to the stereotypical autism that you see in boys (e.g. girls tend to be quite good verbally by comparison). I'm not a doctor but one thing you said made me think of it - the lack of desire for touch from a young age. My sister-in-law had to put her newborn in a separate room as my niece slept better away from people. When she breastfed, my niece would scream to be put down when she finished eating. The screaming stopped as soon as she wasn't being held anymore. I'm assuming this isn't true because your health professionals haven't said anything and a lot of what you describe is the same with my son (who doesn't have autism). But just in case you think that there is something more at play...",2,"Hello all,

I would guess that the longest she has allowed me or my wife to hold her ""like a baby"" since she was about 4 weeks old is maybe 15 seconds.  This hurts from a selfish parenting perspective, but this also makes it to where we basically can't take her to restaurants or most public places because she won't sit in our laps or be entertained for anymore than 5-10 minutes.

With all of this said, she seems to be developing fairly normally.  She knows 20-25 words, some sign language, understands several commands and generally seems eager to please when she is in a good mood.  There within lies the problem, she seems perpetually unhappy.

She wakes up in a bad mood, often times crying/whining until we find whatever random variation of eating/standing that she wants.  We take her to day care and she fights us to get into the car.  When we pick her up, she seems to enjoy day care and seems happy to see us, but then she fights us to go back home.  We chalked this up to some kind of separation anxiety...maybe she doesn't want to leave us in the morning...then adjusts....then doesn't want to leave them in the afternoons?

When we get home, I would guess out of the 2 hours we get to play with her she spends AT LEAST 50% of it unhappy.  Some of it uncontrollable crying, some of it just heavy whining.  If we tell her no or stop her from doing something stupid, she goes into complete meltdown mode every time with no real pattern of how long she will be upset.  Most of the time she hates taking baths, she doesn't seem particularly interested in any of the hundreds of toys our first daughter accumulated(the toys she does use often times are things like forks or inanimate objects).  It's literally a fight almost every night until bed time.  On the weekends, it's basically the same except for longer periods of time, so it's clearly not just her being tired(although that could be some of it during the week).

My wife and I have done our best to try and just pass this off as having a child that is a little more stubborn than most.  We are both home, virtually the entire time after work, everyday.  We actively play with her, and her sister absolutely adores her and tries to play with her too.  The majority of the time we reset and keep positive attitudes around her, but it seems to sometimes only be getting worse.  

We spoke to our doctor at our 1 year checkup and he didn't seem too concerned.  At the time, we noticed she had a lot of runny noses and stuff so we thought maybe she had bad allergies and it was causing her a level of discomfort.  We tried allergy medicine for a few weeks and it didn't change anything.

It should be noted that when she IS in a good mood, she's a really awesome fun kid.  She communicates well, she is really really mobile and is fun.  When we go to other peoples houses she often seems more entertained and acts better.  Maybe she's just bored of our house?  But to THIS level?

Anyway.  I don't even really know what I'm looking for answer wise.  Maybe someone has had similar experiences.  I obviously feel like there are some behavioral type issues we might need to lookout for down the road, but it's not like it's something they can(nor do I likely want) her to be doing at this young age.  

For the longest time my wife and I kept telling ourselves that we weren't being patient enough or we were spoiled because of our first kid, but it's becoming far more worrisome now.  We are having to spend so much time and energy keeping the younger child happy that we aren't spending as much time with our 5 year old.

51,t3_6864qt,,What do the daycare workers say about her behaviour? Just wondering if she also acts like this while she is at daycare or if it's just at home,2,"Hello all,

Writing for advice about my 15 month old daughter.  She's our second child, her sister is 5 years old.

Since she was born it was very clear that she wasn't going to be as laid back and innocent as our older daughter, and that was to be expected(since our first daughter was ridiculously easy to care for).  

As the younger daughter grew up my wife and I were very conscious of some very slight things she did that we didn't think were normal.  Banging head head against the wall(lightly), more severe tantrums than we were used to seeing, not attaching herself to any real toys or even showing a remote slight interest in the TV or watching photos or movies on our phone in situations where we are trying to keep her calm.

52,t3_6864qt,RightHoJeeves,"I just wanted to comment with solidarity. You've basically described my daughter and we are still in the 'think of it' as she's just 20 months old. She's our first, so we didn't know any different but we felt constantly feel like we are failing as parents because she's just so. unhappy. 

She's so sensitive, clingy, dependent, testing, stubborn, and generally a 'difficult child.' She doesn't avoid touch/cuddles but it's sort of rare. 

I agree with other commenters that your kid just has a different temperament than your first. 

We haven't found that anything 'works' per se, but I've adjusted my expectations of parenting, I've picked my battles with her, I try to set her up for success, etc. It's still so hard and I'm constantly exhausted. I have a secret resentment of parents with 'easy babies'. They will never know! ",1,"Hello all,

56,t3_6864qt,ZBTHorton,"Obviously autism is on our radar, she has some signs.  But she's also developing so well, it makes us feel like we're just overanalyzing things.

I do think we'll be able to plan more trips to the park and similar once she ages just a bit more and that will be nice.  Our trips to the grocery store are super stressful right now because she won't listen to us, but I'd think eventually she will get better at that too.  She loves going to the store, we just eventually have to leave or move to another aisle and it becomes a problem.

Our affection issues definitely aren't as bad as your sister in laws.  She just doesn't really want to be held, but it seems like mostly because she doesn't want so sit still.  One thing that has been promising on that front that I didn't write above is that in the past month she has learned how to ""give hugs"" where she gives your neck a squeeze.

My wife and I have done our best to try and just pass this off as having a child that is a little more stubborn than most.  We are both home, virtually the entire time after work, everyday.  We actively play with her, and her sister absolutely adores her and tries to play with her too.  The majority of the time we reset and keep positive attitudes around her, but it seems to sometimes only be getting worse.  

We spoke to our doctor at our 1 year checkup and he didn't seem too concerned.  At the time, we noticed she had a lot of runny noses and stuff so we thought maybe she had bad allergies and it was causing her a level of discomfort.  We tried allergy medicine for a few weeks and it didn't change anything.

It should be noted that when she IS in a good mood, she's a really awesome fun kid.  She communicates well, she is really really mobile and is fun.  When we go to other peoples houses she often seems more entertained and acts better.  Maybe she's just bored of our house?  But to THIS level?

Anyway.  I don't even really know what I'm looking for answer wise.  Maybe someone has had similar experiences.  I obviously feel like there are some behavioral type issues we might need to lookout for down the road, but it's not like it's something they can(nor do I likely want) her to be doing at this young age.  

For the longest time my wife and I kept telling ourselves that we weren't being patient enough or we were spoiled because of our first kid, but it's becoming far more worrisome now.  We are having to spend so much time and energy keeping the younger child happy that we aren't spending as much time with our 5 year old.

57,t3_6864qt,ZBTHorton,"When she was in the baby room <1yo I think she had a similar reputation. A little difficult to work with, but not overly so.  

Since she moved up and began walking they seem to love her. She seems entertained with the kids and toys, which baffles us since she has 3 of us at home and way better toys. Heh. ",1,"Hello all,

Writing for advice about my 15 month old daughter.  She's our second child, her sister is 5 years old.

Since she was born it was very clear that she wasn't going to be as laid back and innocent as our older daughter, and that was to be expected(since our first daughter was ridiculously easy to care for).  

As the younger daughter grew up my wife and I were very conscious of some very slight things she did that we didn't think were normal.  Banging head head against the wall(lightly), more severe tantrums than we were used to seeing, not attaching herself to any real toys or even showing a remote slight interest in the TV or watching photos or movies on our phone in situations where we are trying to keep her calm.  The big item we noticed though was that she had absolutely no interest in any sort of cuddling or hugs or any affection of any kind.  As soon as she was strong enough to hold herself up, she would most times literally push us away.  It sucked, but we just figured it was the difference between two kids.  I would guess that the longest she has allowed me or my wife to hold her ""like a baby"" since she was about 4 weeks old is maybe 15 seconds.  This hurts from a selfish parenting perspective, but this also makes it to where we basically can't take her to restaurants or most public places because she won't sit in our laps or be entertained for anymore than 5-10 minutes.

With all of this said, she seems to be developing fairly normally.  She knows 20-25 words, some sign language, understands several commands and generally seems eager to please when she is in a good mood.  There within lies the problem, she seems perpetually unhappy.

She wakes up in a bad mood, often times crying/whining until we find whatever random variation of eating/standing that she wants.  We take her to day care and she fights us to get into the car.  When we pick her up, she seems to enjoy day care and seems happy to see us, but then she fights us to go back home.  We chalked this up to some kind of separation anxiety...maybe she doesn't want to leave us in the morning...then adjusts....then doesn't want to leave them in the afternoons?

When we get home, I would guess out of the 2 hours we get to play with her she spends AT LEAST 50% of it unhappy.  Some of it uncontrollable crying, some of it just heavy whining.  If we tell her no or stop her from doing something stupid, she goes into complete meltdown mode every time with no real pattern of how long she will be upset.  Most of the time she hates taking baths, she doesn't seem particularly interested in any of the hundreds of toys our first daughter accumulated(the toys she does use often times are things like forks or inanimate objects).  It's literally a fight almost every night until bed time.

The big item we noticed though was that she had absolutely no interest in any sort of cuddling or hugs or any affection of any kind.  As soon as she was strong enough to hold herself up, she would most times literally push us away.  It sucked, but we just figured it was the difference between two kids.  I would guess that the longest she has allowed me or my wife to hold her ""like a baby"" since she was about 4 weeks old is maybe 15 seconds.  This hurts from a selfish parenting perspective, but this also makes it to where we basically can't take her to restaurants or most public places because she won't sit in our laps or be entertained for anymore than 5-10 minutes.

With all of this said, she seems to be developing fairly normally.  She knows 20-25 words, some sign language, understands several commands and generally seems eager to please when she is in a good mood.  There within lies the problem, she seems perpetually unhappy.

She wakes up in a bad mood, often times crying/whining until we find whatever random variation of eating/standing that she wants.  We take her to day care and she fights us to get into the car.  When we pick her up, she seems to enjoy day care and seems happy to see us, but then she fights us to go back home.  We chalked this up to some kind of separation anxiety...maybe she doesn't want to leave us in the morning...then adjusts....then doesn't want to leave them in the afternoons?

When we get home, I would guess out of the 2 hours we get to play with her she spends AT LEAST 50% of it unhappy.  Some of it uncontrollable crying, some of it just heavy whining.  If we tell her no or stop her from doing something stupid, she goes into complete meltdown mode every time with no real pattern of how long she will be upset.  Most of the time she hates taking baths, she doesn't seem particularly interested in any of the hundreds of toys our first daughter accumulated(the toys she does use often times are things like forks or inanimate objects).  It's literally a fight almost every night until bed time.  On the weekends, it's basically the same except for longer periods of time, so it's clearly not just her being tired(although that could be some of it during the week).

My wife and I have done our best to try and just pass this off as having a child that is a little more stubborn than most.  We are both home, virtually the entire time after work, everyday.  We actively play with her, and her sister absolutely adores her and tries to play with her too.  The majority of the time we reset and keep positive attitudes around her, but it seems to sometimes only be getting worse.  

We spoke to our doctor at our 1 year checkup and he didn't seem too concerned.  At the time, we noticed she had a lot of runny noses and stuff so we thought maybe she had bad allergies and it was causing her a level of discomfort.  We tried allergy medicine for a few weeks and it didn't change anything.

It should be noted that when she IS in a good mood, she's a really awesome fun kid.  She communicates well, she is really really mobile and is fun.  When we go to other peoples houses she often seems more entertained and acts better.  Maybe she's just bored of our house?  But to THIS level?

Anyway.  I don't even really know what I'm looking for answer wise.  Maybe someone has had similar experiences.  I obviously feel like there are some behavioral type issues we might need to lookout for down the road, but it's not like it's something they can(nor do I likely want) her to be doing at this young age.  

For the longest time my wife and I kept telling ourselves that we weren't being patient enough or we were spoiled because of our first kid, but it's becoming far more worrisome now.  We are having to spend so much time and energy keeping the younger child happy that we aren't spending as much time with our 5 year old.  

Thanks for reading.  Any help would be wonderful. :)

67,t3_4sr1k0,DoublePlusGoodly,"Hey there. I see there are no other replies and since I *finally* got my LO to sleep for the night, I thought I'd chime in. I have three kiddos - ages 17, 14, and an 8 month old. It sounds to me like you might have a ""spirited"" child on your hands! It would probably be more efficient for you to google the term ""spirited children"" and start reading than for me to explain. But, in essence, your kiddo is more expressive, emotional, energetic, and intense than the majority of kids his age. I know it can be really really trying to paarent a spirited child. But, it's not all bad! The same qualities that make your kiddo expressive, emotional, energetic, and intense will make him into an insightful, enthusiastic, outside-the-box thinker and do-er as he matures! I know it sounds simplistic the way I explain it, but that's where googling and reading about the topic of ""spirited children"" will be helpful. It's challenging and a wild ride to have & parent a spirited kiddo, but I promise you, it's never boring or dull! Seriously, they amaze you constantly!",3,"Ok so this may be a long post/rant but I will try to summarize it if you don't want to read the whole thing.

So my son is 14 months old this week and I love him very much but the truth is he can be so difficult most days and the techniques that everyone else seems to use don't seem to work with him at all. (Redirection, distractions, etc...)

He has always been an ""expressive baby"" and from week one he was Collic. By the time he was three months he would want to be held all the time but only facing out and would squirm and cry unless you held him that way.

As he aged and became more mobile he has begun exploring the world and getting into everything. I encourage him to explore and provide him with plenty of activities and experiences in which to do so but some things must be off limits and he does not handle denied access well at all.

Recently he has begun throwing tantrums when he doesn't get what he wants and they are super intense and on most days very frequent. A good example is that he has learned how to climb the couch and we don't want him climbing the couch because it is high off the ground and it is also the only place where out dogs can escape from him when he is being rough with them (he is hitting them and pulling their tails right now while he learns how to have gentle hands). We have always been firm about the couch and never have allowed him up but he is persistent and when we don't allow him he melts down every time and we have an emotional mess on our hands for twenty minutes (screaming at he top of his lungs, red in the face, arched back, banging head in the ground etc...)
We often try to use objects to redirect his attention and distract him but he is usually completely uninterested in anything except the task at hand (whether it be climbing he couch or trying to get into the bathroom that he can now open on his own)

These behaviors apply to pretty much any situation now and any time we try to redirect him he has a complete meltdown. The other day we were at the beach and he wanted to run into another families picnic area and steal a toy their daughter was playing with and I tried to distract him by offering him his shovel and redirect his attention away and he lost it right there and then.

Somehow he manages to find something that I need to get from him wherever we go (he will eat any rocks/paper/dirt/dangerous item he finds) and of course will have a tantrum if I try to take it, even with a distraction trade.

My son melts down when he gets in the car seat

My son melts down when I leave the room

My son melts down when I take anything from him

My son melts down every single time he naps or goes to bed

It feels like my son melts down if he doesn't get exactly what he wants and even then he sometimes just melts down for seemingly no reasons

I don't know what course of action to take, do I ignore his tantrums or do I try and comfort him?

How can I work with my son to avoid the constant emotional breakdowns and teach him self regulations and boundaries?

Right now I feel like I am a shitty parent and must be doing something wrong.



SUMMARY

my son does not respond to redirection or distractions well and has emotional meltdowns multiple times a day when he doesn't get what he wants.

How can I help avoid these conflicts with him?

And

How should I deal with his meltdowns when they occur?

Thank you for letting me vent and hopefully someone had an answer because I am at my wits end.

68,t3_4sr1k0,Jumpgirl,"The other posters comment is really good. My son is only 3 months old but I see the beginnings of it already. I watch a close friends 3 year old and he is exactly that- a spirited child. He certainly can be a handful, but there are lots of parenting strategies specifically to help parents of those kids! They usually are highly intelligent and emotional, and that will become a good thing for them once their brains have developed and matured further. Right now it's so hard for them to control their emotions and impulses, because those parts of the brain are still severely underdeveloped. And spirited kids have a lot of emotions and impulses! 
You're not doing anything wrong, and there are many other parents struggling with the same things you are. I know every day feels like a battleground but it won't always.

70,t3_4sr1k0,EverySingleStar,"My son is only 6.5 months but I'm absolutely positive that he will be like your son at 14 months. I see other people have mentioned spirited children which is how I've been describing my son (well currently I describe him as ""high need"" but spirited sounds nicer lol). Nothing to add except to say you're not alone. I'm sure your experiences when your son was smaller were similar to mine. When my son cries, he CRIES. And he may go absolutely red in the face and do the ""silent cry"" when I so much as walk away for a moment to go to the kitchen. If he doesn't feel like being on his tummy when I've placed him on it, he makes his displeasure known, loudly and clearly. I have known his ""high need"" tendencies for quite some time but what put it in even more perspective is seeing other babies his age. Their whines and cries are at like 1/10th of the volume and intensity. The days can be very challenging but I try to appreciate how this will translate into awesome qualities as he gets older. I think a lot of high need/spirited kids are intelligent, perceptive, inquisitive and determined. In addition to being great traits I also feel that I can learn a lot from raising my spirited son! It's definitely a lesson in patience/how to remain calm, that's for sure!",1,"Ok so this may be a long post/rant but I will try to summarize it if you don't want to read the whole thing.

Recently he has begun throwing tantrums when he doesn't get what he wants and they are super intense and on most days very frequent. A good example is that he has learned how to climb the couch and we don't want him climbing the couch because it is high off the ground and it is also the only place where out dogs can escape from him when he is being rough with them (he is hitting them and pulling their tails right now while he learns how to have gentle hands). We have always been firm about the couch and never have allowed him up but he is persistent and when we don't allow him he melts down every time and we have an emotional mess on our hands for twenty minutes (screaming at he top of his lungs, red in the face, arched back, banging head in the ground etc...)
We often try to use objects to redirect his attention and distract him but he is usually completely uninterested in anything except the task at hand (whether it be climbing he couch or trying to get into the bathroom that he can now open on his own)

These behaviors apply to pretty much any situation now and any time we try to redirect him he has a complete meltdown. The other day we were at the beach and he wanted to run into another families picnic area and steal a toy their daughter was playing with and I tried to distract him by offering him his shovel and redirect his attention away and he lost it right there and then.

Somehow he manages to find something that I need to get from him wherever we go (he will eat any rocks/paper/dirt/dangerous item he finds) and of course will have a tantrum if I try to take it, even with a distraction trade.

My son melts down when he gets in the car seat

My son melts down when I leave the room

My son melts down when I take anything from him

My son melts down every single time he naps or goes to bed

It feels like my son melts down if he doesn't get exactly what he wants and even then he sometimes just melts down for seemingly no reasons

I don't know what course of action to take, do I ignore his tantrums or do I try and comfort him?

How can I work with my son to avoid the constant emotional breakdowns and teach him self regulations and boundaries?

Right now I feel like I am a shitty parent and must be doing something wrong.



SUMMARY

my son does not respond to redirection or distractions well and has emotional meltdowns multiple times a day when he doesn't get what he wants.

How can I help avoid these conflicts with him?

And

How should I deal with his meltdowns when they occur?

Thank you for letting me vent and hopefully someone had an answer because I am at my wits end.

72,t3_4sr1k0,frankmillie,"Yeah, I agree with the other poster in looking into 'spirited child'. It can be really tough for the parent- exhausting. But it definitely helps to look at those difficult qualities as a toddler as really awesome adult qualities- being focused and determined makes for a very successful adult. Something I have noticed is that spirited kids have a really difficult time with transitions- so giving plenty of notice before something is going to happen- like if you are going somewhere for the day, talk about it several times beforehand. I babysat a kid that this was huge- he really appreciated (at age 3) us talking through our whole plan for the day, and then as we did things from our plan, we talked about that and what we still had left to do.

Now after that my son was collic and would cry 70% of the day on most days and so that whole phase kinda bled into the next and his collic changed into fussy.

I would say at three months I started to notice that he was ""needy"" and wanted things a certain way (wanting to be held facing out, wanting to be held all the time)

He has always been an ""expressive baby"" and from week one he was Collic. By the time he was three months he would want to be held all the time but only facing out and would squirm and cry unless you held him that way.

As he aged and became more mobile he has begun exploring the world and getting into everything. I encourage him to explore and provide him with plenty of activities and experiences in which to do so but some things must be off limits and he does not handle denied access well at all.

Recently he has begun throwing tantrums when he doesn't get what he wants and they are super intense and on most days very frequent. A good example is that he has learned how to climb the couch and we don't want him climbing the couch because it is high off the ground and it is also the only place where out dogs can escape from him when he is being rough with them (he is hitting them and pulling their tails right now while he learns how to have gentle hands). We have always been firm about the couch and never have allowed him up but he is persistent and when we don't allow him he melts down every time and we have an emotional mess on our hands for twenty minutes (screaming at he top of his lungs, red in the face, arched back, banging head in the ground etc...)
We often try to use objects to redirect his attention and distract him but he is usually completely uninterested in anything except the task at hand (whether it be climbing he couch or trying to get into the bathroom that he can now open on his own)

These behaviors apply to pretty much any situation now and any time we try to redirect him he has a complete meltdown. The other day we were at the beach and he wanted to run into another families picnic area and steal a toy their daughter was playing with and I tried to distract him by offering him his shovel and redirect his attention away and he lost it right there and then.

Somehow he manages to find something that I need to get from him wherever we go (he will eat any rocks/paper/dirt/dangerous item he finds) and of course will have a tantrum if I try to take it, even with a distraction trade.

My son melts down when he gets in the car seat

My son melts down when I leave the room

My son melts down when I take anything from him

My son melts down every single time he naps or goes to bed

It feels like my son melts down if he doesn't get exactly what he wants and even then he sometimes just melts down for seemingly no reasons

I don't know what course of action to take, do I ignore his tantrums or do I try and comfort him?

How can I work with my son to avoid the constant emotional breakdowns and teach him self regulations and boundaries?

Right now I feel like I am a shitty parent and must be doing something wrong.



SUMMARY

my son does not respond to redirection or distractions well and has emotional meltdowns multiple times a day when he doesn't get what he wants.

How can I help avoid these conflicts with him?

And

How should I deal with his meltdowns when they occur?

Thank you for letting me vent and hopefully someone had an answer because I am at my wits end.

80,t3_4sr1k0,DoublePlusGoodly,"Glad it helped! My 14 year old son was a spirited baby & toddler. From my experience, I can say that spirited kids are often highly intelligent and may also have sensitivities to things like certain noises, tastes, smells, textures, or certain types of clothig, so be on the lookout for that stuff too. It gets waaay easier as the child becomes more verbal, but until they are more verbal, I think they find the state of ""being a baby"" quite frustrating! My 14 year old is a really neat kid now. Anything he wants to learn about or do, he just does. He fixes all manner of small engines and refurbishes vintage chainsaws.  Last summer he built a root cellar pretty much by himself. He planted and maintained a large summer garden. This summer, he's learning to code java for fun and going to volunteer in the national forest and doing crosscut saw training / work for the summer. Never a dull moment with the spirited ones! If I had any advice, as your little one grows, be sure to model language for expressing the wide array of emotions they have, and talk about your emotions too! Give them the language to verbalize what they are feeling because they feel a lot! Reading books on developing ""emotional intelligence""  can be helpful. 

Best of luck to you guys!",2,"Ok so this may be a long post/rant but I will try to summarize it if you don't want to read the whole thing.

82,t3_3b9io4,JoNightshade,"Don't punish him for this! Your kid wants to be independent and do things himself, and that is WONDERFUL! 

You need to look for things he CAN do and show him how to do it. My first was like this (insanely independent) and whenever we have behavior issues with him it is ALWAYS solved by me giving him more responsibility in some area. 

So what things around your house CAN your toddler do? Don't underestimate him! Is he still in a high chair or anything like that? If so, put him in a regular chair and give him regular utensils and a glass. Yes you will have messes, but you will also have a very proud kid. Can he dress himself? Teach him how to do that. Put all of his clothes and toys at a level where he can reach it. Get him a stepstool and teach him how to turn the lights on and off, and then ask him to do it for you whenever you need to turn the lights on/off. Give him authority and choice! 

This is difficult now, but trust me - if you nurture this quality you will have a FANTASTIC human being on your hands. ;) ",9,"Sorry in advance as this is going to be long. I have a toddler who is so independent its causing a boatload of stress in our family. He will be 2 next week, and this has been going on about 4 months. He throws tantrums very easily, full on tears and snot, and banging his forehead on the ground causing bruises and blood sometimes.

Just examples from today on how he is dictating our lives: 

* he won't get into his car seat unless he can open the car door himself (he can't so we have to try and subtly open it while he is pulling on it). If he doesn't open it himself he closes it and starts over. If we pick him up to put him in its full on tantrum and we have to force him into his harness.
* Getting *out* of the carseat, he has to unbuckle the chest clasp himself. Once again, he is incapable of this on his own, so when I squeeze the clip and he pulls he clicks it in again, and again, and again... until I get tired of standing there and pull him out. Commence tantrum.
* Wanted to play with chalk, I get him some. Older brother tries to play with him but 2 year old throws fit. So I get a package of chalk for my 4 year old who very nicely gives the chalk he was holding to his brother. 2 year old continues with tantrum, banging head on asphalt and throwing the chalk. I take him inside and he rolls around on the floor crying. He goes back outside to the chalk and continues screaming and crying, and I have *no idea* what is making him so mad. He comes back inside and happily eats a sandwich with a smile and tears and snot on his face.

Those are just in the one hour span of time that I pick them up from daycare and go home and get dinner going. These things start in the morning and go on until he is asleep, for us. The daycare people tell us he is good. 

I feel like all he does is cry and make any thing that we try to do as a family miserable. My husband and I are super stressed and have been fighting more and its really causing issues for us as a unit, not to mention our older son is suffering. He constantly has to give in, or gives things up, because of his brother.

Does anyone have any tactics for us? We have tried time out, and it semi-works in the moment but he just does the same crap all day. We don't feel he is old enough to spank. I have tried hugging him when he gets like this but he just wants to get away and contact seems to make him angrier. We have tried ignoring him, but the tantrums continue as long as he wants.

We're really at a loss as to where to go from here. He used to be a very sweet kid, super laid back and easy going. Ever since he has discovered how to do a few things on his own, though, its been a nightmare to be honest. Thanks if you read this far!"
83,t3_3b9io4,2ndstartotheright,"I don't think any form of punishment will help, since he's likely just responding to his own frustration, lack of understanding or being overwhelmed. I would imagine it would just confuse him. 

When my oldest (2.5) gets like this, we try to divide and conquer--husband usually continues the activity or exits the situation with BabyBug and I either stay with ToddlerBug or move us to a more appropriate location to cool down. He doesn't like to be held when he's tantrumming either, so I mostly just sit and listen, occasionally paraphrasing any information I can glean about his frustrations. ""You _really_ want to buckle your car seat yourself!"" ""It makes you mad, mad, MAD when your shoes won't go on."" That sort of thing. 

It's basically combining [""staylistening""](http://www.handinhandparenting.org/article/what-to-say-during-staylistening/) with some advice from ""Happiest Toddler on the Block"" about using ""toddler-ese"" (short statements, matched emotional intensity) to get through. It takes much less time for him to cool down this way than alone, but it still sucks. 

I'm sorry you're experiencing strain on your family because of this. Our boy's episodes have gotten a lot less frequent in the last 6 months.

84,t3_3b9io4,athaliah,"Wow. My daughter does this except not to the extent that she hurts herself. 

I usually let her do things she wants to do by herself, even if it takes awhile. If I start getting impatient, i'll ask if she wants me to help. Usually she starts to get frustrated and eventually agrees. If she keeps saying no, i'll give her another task to distract her - ""how about I do this while you do that?"" and she accepts. If that doesn't work, I drop it and try again in 10 minutes. I only forcefully take over in the worst case scenario because I like my eardrums.

Of course there are some things I can't let her do, and I don't, even though they end in a tantrum. I explain to her why she can't do whatever it is and try to distract her with other suggestions until something sticks ""would you like a hug? would you like to go play with bubbles? would you like to help me water the plants?"" If that doesn't work, then I just ignore it for a little while.

85,t3_3b9io4,cherryphoenix,"This too shall pass. It is infuriating and draining but it is perfectly normal and shows that your child is developing. He realized that he is his own person and that he can have effect in the outside world and people around him.

Also at 2 it's still hard to communicate when something frustrates you or make you mad, hence the tantrum. His little brain is creating new neurons and connections every day! Which is awesome! He is slowly becoming a person, your little man! 

My own son was very difficult during his second year. We just had to ride it out. I would try to help him and he would throw a tantrum. The only thing that work for me is to let my son some space to evacuate all his frustration, while making sure he doesn't hurt himself, and go back to him for some cuddles when he calmed down. But every child is different.

Those are just in the one hour span of time that I pick them up from daycare and go home and get dinner going. These things start in the morning and go on until he is asleep, for us. The daycare people tell us he is good. 

I feel like all he does is cry and make any thing that we try to do as a family miserable. My husband and I are super stressed and have been fighting more and its really causing issues for us as a unit, not to mention our older son is suffering. He constantly has to give in, or gives things up, because of his brother.

Does anyone have any tactics for us? We have tried time out, and it semi-works in the moment but he just does the same crap all day. We don't feel he is old enough to spank. I have tried hugging him when he gets like this but he just wants to get away and contact seems to make him angrier. We have tried ignoring him, but the tantrums continue as long as he wants.

We're really at a loss as to where to go from here. He used to be a very sweet kid, super laid back and easy going. Ever since he has discovered how to do a few things on his own, though, its been a nightmare to be honest. Thanks if you read this far!"
88,t3_3b9io4,ParanoidFactoid,"Could he want attention? And love? Perhaps he misses mommy while in daycare. 

Someone else recommended against punishment, and I agree. This kid wants to learn. Punish him and you'll train against learning. Support him and be patient. ",4,"Sorry in advance as this is going to be long. I have a toddler who is so independent its causing a boatload of stress in our family. He will be 2 next week, and this has been going on about 4 months. He throws tantrums very easily, full on tears and snot, and banging his forehead on the ground causing bruises and blood sometimes.

Just examples from today on how he is dictating our lives: 

* he won't get into his car seat unless he can open the car door himself (he can't so we have to try and subtly open it while he is pulling on it). If he doesn't open it himself he closes it and starts over. If we pick him up to put him in its full on tantrum and we have to force him into his harness.
* Getting *out* of the carseat, he has to unbuckle the chest clasp himself. Once again, he is incapable of this on his own, so when I squeeze the clip and he pulls he clicks it in again, and again, and again... until I get tired of standing there and pull him out. Commence tantrum.
* Wanted to play with chalk, I get him some. Older brother tries to play with him but 2 year old throws fit. So I get a package of chalk for my 4 year old who very nicely gives the chalk he was holding to his brother. 2 year old continues with tantrum, banging head on asphalt and throwing the chalk.

I think this is just an awful, awful stage that all toddlers go through. And i dont really think there's anything you can do to stop it. It'll just pass in its own time... My son is three now and his tantrums are waaay less frequent. (I will say that they are way more intense and involve a lot more kicking and screaming... But anyway...)

91,t3_3b9io4,rctwinkies,"I have a kid like this, has been for a while.  I think the tantrums are their way of expressing their frustration because they don't quite have the skills they need for whatever they are trying to do.  As my daughter had gotten older, we've noticed that she is really focused and determined to figure out how things work.  She takes things apart and puts them back together.  She decided she wanted to dress herself so she literally would take off all her clothes and put them back on, repeatedly, for hours until she was good at it.  Same with shoes, potty training, climbing the big slide, the alphabet, etc.  we are pretty sure she's gonna be an engineer.  I wouldn't punish.  I would figure out what you are willing to let him do and just accept the fact that getting in/out of the car is a long process.

In addition to that, we'd ask him to help us with things. Moving laundry from the washer to the dryer, stirring food in pots on the stove (with supervision) among other things.

97,t3_5s8exi,xNeyNounex,"It is a normal, but weird, self-soothing behavior. 

Head-banging and shaking. This may be the most alarming of all the self-soothing techniques listed here. Some toddlers have a tendency to bang their heads (against the wall, against furniture, against the crib bars, etc.) before naps or bed. Some toddlers will also shake their heads back and forth vigorously.

Some toddlers engage in these kinds of behaviors because they aren’t getting enough one-on-one contact with parents or caregivers — so they make up for that lack of cuddling and affection by trying to create it themselves.

For a small percentage of children, these kinds of behaviors indicate deeper, underlying issues, like learning disabilities, ADD-ADHD, or autism. They can also be a sign of Sensory Processing Disorder.

If your toddler is banging his head against something hard (like the wall), you can try padding the area where he does most of his banging.

When your toddler starts doing the repetitive behavior, be sure to take the time to offer plenty of cuddling and kisses. If your toddler is old enough to talk with you, you may also want to try asking how he’s feeling, and if anything’s wrong. You could say something like, “I see you’re pulling on your ears – are you feeling worried? Did anything happen today that made you feel bad?”

Totally normal. Just rambunctious, active boys doing their thing. I almost laughed, as a Gramma, as both my own son and now His son - both very energetic, busy boys with lots of head bashing involved.

104,t3_5s8exi,kielbasarama,Oh wow.  Thank you so much for this. He shakes his head a lot too. I have SPD but hadn't considered that as a possibility. My son is often trying to get down and doesn't really let me cuddle with him much. He is affectionate but on his own terms. He sleeps in my arm and I nurse him for a nap and throughout the day but other than that he doesn't really get much touch I suppose. I hold him occasionally but like I said he's always trying to get down. He does seem very relaxed when in a carrier or sling though. I haven't been using it much recently just thinking that he was busy learning to walk and wanted to move around. He's only 13 months so he can't talk about feelings. He doesn't say any words yet which I know can also be a possible indication of problems but he does clearly communicate with gestures and understand what we are saying. I guess I need to keep an eye on it. Thanks again. ,2,"This seems like one of those ""maybe dumb"" questions but my 13 month old is banging his head off of things.

107,t3_40jim2,Master_Katara,"I don't have a ""right"" answer for you but this is what I would do in that situation: get something he can't escape from (like a pack n play) and figure out a way to affix pillows to any part of it he could hurt himself on. Every time he bangs his head stick him in there ASAP and wait out the nuclear meltdown. Do not let him out at all until he has calmed down (he will likely tantrum himself to sleep a few times). If after a few weeks you determine this has made no difference or things are worse talk to his pediatrician and see what professional help you can get for him.

110,t3_40jim2,TC1208,"Thank you! It's not just something I can go about ignoring because one day he could accidentally do it on the corner of our end table instead of another part that he meant to hit. 

I think I've found the correlation to when this started, but it's a bit complicated. My husbands parents used to watch them while we worked, then they got sick of it and started sticking his (somewhat) physically disabled sister with the job by herself (don't get me started on that because I'm pissed about it but we can't afford day care and our schedules don't accommodate any day cares around here). So around that time is when he started getting bad. I don't know if she's disciplining differently or not giving enough attention or what, but this all started when she started watching them by herself. So ugh... I don't know how to bring this up with my husband and his mom because it's such a sore spot.

116,t3_1quzcv,mavebarak,"I have no actual medical backup here, but babies are sort of built to develop the way that they do. IMO this includes the occasional head bounce...however, i can't say I don't worry about my LO too.

To help with our worries, we got some foam playmat that we throw down on the floor, and before she was crawling and cruising all over we would stratigically place pillows so she'd hopefully hit those if we didn't catch her.  

She has developed catching herself most of the time, and a portion of me says that a big reason is because of the pillows and the opps when she was first starting out.

Hugs to you...You're doing great!",2,"My eight month old sits and crawls pretty good, but it seems at least once a day he reaches for something and loses his balance, falling backwards from a sitting position and banging his head on the floor.  I only manage to catch him maybe 70% of the time.  Sometimes this happens on the wood and sometimes on the carpet, but it always makes a loud thump and he wails for a few minutes before he's ready to resume play. 

Since this happens at least a few times a week, I've begun to wonder if he could end up with brain damage from the frequent head banging.   It seems the sudden collision could shake his brain similar to what happens with shaken baby syndrome...or maybe he's getting mini-concussions each time. Am I worrying too much?  Any professional medical insights into this?"

As long as he doesn't lose consciousness or bleed profusely, he'll be a-okay!",2,"My eight month old sits and crawls pretty good, but it seems at least once a day he reaches for something and loses his balance, falling backwards from a sitting position and banging his head on the floor.  I only manage to catch him maybe 70% of the time.  Sometimes this happens on the wood and sometimes on the carpet, but it always makes a loud thump and he wails for a few minutes before he's ready to resume play. 

Since this happens at least a few times a week, I've begun to wonder if he could end up with brain damage from the frequent head banging.   It seems the sudden collision could shake his brain similar to what happens with shaken baby syndrome...or maybe he's getting mini-concussions each time. Am I worrying too much?  Any professional medical insights into this?"

Another episode in the disaster of my life...

I ended up taking the high ground and decided to co-chaperone a group with my ex, knowing my son would be so excited to have both his parents on the field trip.

Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival.

I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today.

Thank you for all the responses!! I really appreciate it. The range of comments is very interesting. Everyone read the same post, yet responses range from ""chill out it's a simple mistake"" to ""you should change your child custody ASAP"". I think it goes to show what an impact everyone's own experience has on interpretation of content!

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"
123,t3_bk0xm8,StarryJuliet,"In terms of what others will think - divorces families are not new. People understand custody and having to split parenting time. So that part is totally understandable. And I’ll bet that there are other divorced moms in your kids’ classes/ grades that are in similar situations. You’re new and still getting your bearings - friends will come in time. I know it’s hard to be patient. It sounds like you’re on track for doing everything right.

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"
127,t3_bk0xm8,poetniknowit,"It could have been worse! 18 years old I was invited to chaperone my little sisters fourth grade field trip to the zoo LOL. All of the kids wanted to be in my group because I was this pierced neon haired crazy person in comparison to all the boring parents and teachers. We toured the grounds, fed some animals, and then as we turned a corner we promptly walked up to the giraffe exhibit where they got a front row seat two animal mating season! I had to give an impromptu birds-and-bees discussion to 4th graders while a male giraffe mounted a female giraffe LOL.

So it could have been worse?",6,"I posted about this co-parenting dilemma a week ago or so when me kid's dad (my ex) and I both volunteered to chaperone a field trip. I was upset at having to decide to either not go or share the experience with him and the struggles of co-parenting in general. Well, let me tell you how things went! Another episode in the disaster of my life...

I ended up taking the high ground and decided to co-chaperone a group with my ex, knowing my son would be so excited to have both his parents on the field trip. I was disappointed, but it was the right thing to do. Then a couple days before, his dad said he can't go because he has an interview. I was thrilled and thought I had earned some good karma points by deciding we'd both go!

Here we are, day of the field trip. I'm so excited to have the day off from work to enjoy with my son. They are at their dads house this week, so I show up at the school to meet up with the class, without my son, expecting his Dad dropped him off like normal. Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community. This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

131,t3_bk0xm8,Anony-mous99,"I totally feel for your situation and glad you have a more detailed update about who he is. I’m actually dealing with similar with my kid’s narcissistic dad and as things were good 24hours ago they are back to verbal abuse and demands and disrespect. I understand the struggle to make a decision of getting the bad dad out or keeping him around bc he loves his kids.. I’m figuring that one out still. I’m personally leaning towards getting full custody and debating between allowing visitation if possible.. I know my kid will find out the hard way what kinda person he is and I’m just lost as to which negative impact to take... either he asks why doesn’t dad get him or be around the negative behavior because he isn’t a positive role model, or the blame eventually of why I prevent dad from seeing him. Either option sucks. But I hope with the second option he’s around more positive situations that will put weigh the cons to it and hopefully understands one day I was trying to protect him.

I ended up taking the high ground and decided to co-chaperone a group with my ex, knowing my son would be so excited to have both his parents on the field trip. I was disappointed, but it was the right thing to do. Then a couple days before, his dad said he can't go because he has an interview. I was thrilled and thought I had earned some good karma points by deciding we'd both go!

Here we are, day of the field trip. I'm so excited to have the day off from work to enjoy with my son. They are at their dads house this week, so I show up at the school to meet up with the class, without my son, expecting his Dad dropped him off like normal. Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community. This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

Thank you for all the responses!! I really appreciate it. The range of comments is very interesting.

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"

136,t3_bk0xm8,Mortlach78,"Why is it so hard???

A question we often ask ourselves too. My stepdaughter is turning 14 this month and her relationship with her biodad has been extremely difficult right from the start to the point where she would just refuse to go visit for extended amounts of time until a certain issue at his house was resolved or he found the right thing to bribe her with.Her mom and I have always tried to remain neutral and encouraged her to try to fix things, advocated for her to him, organized family counseling so they could work stuff out, etc. It's now been over a year since she's seen her bio-dad and she has basically decided he's dead to her. And honestly, I understand completely; he's a narcissistic PoS who tries to control her, breaks promises, doesn't care about her as a person, only as a 'trophy'. Of the many, many issues that were going on in their household, him speaking a foreign language with his new wife (and fight in said language) while our daughter is in the room/car with them, is only the tip of the iceberg).

Anyway, so our daughter was bullied in school to such an extent that we had to take her out on medical grounds (stress/insomnia due to bullying). We want to try some form of homeschooling, but bio-dad refuses to give permission - again, hasn't seen or talked to his child in well over a year. He doesn't know the school schedule (we had to send him a link to the school website) yet he is adamant he's involved in the decision making.

The moment she turns 18 and we're finally officially free of that man will be celebrated to the high heavens!

Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community. This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

Thank you for all the responses!! I really appreciate it. The range of comments is very interesting.

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"
138,t3_bk0xm8,Itwaswhatitwas1,"My ex is similar. He’s a narcissist and nothing is ever his fault.

Here we are, day of the field trip. I'm so excited to have the day off from work to enjoy with my son.

I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried.

Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me.

143,t3_bk0xm8,KillerMichala1924,In a 50/50 custody case no one pays child support each parent has the kids needs at their home such as seperate clothes ach parent has equal rights to what is done to the kids as far as medical and schooling.,-14,"I posted about this co-parenting dilemma a week ago or so when me kid's dad (my ex) and I both volunteered to chaperone a field trip. I was upset at having to decide to either not go or share the experience with him and the struggles of co-parenting in general. Well, let me tell you how things went! Another episode in the disaster of my life...

I ended up taking the high ground and decided to co-chaperone a group with my ex, knowing my son would be so excited to have both his parents on the field trip. I was disappointed, but it was the right thing to do. Then a couple days before, his dad said he can't go because he has an interview. I was thrilled and thought I had earned some good karma points by deciding we'd both go!

Here we are, day of the field trip. I'm so excited to have the day off from work to enjoy with my son. They are at their dads house this week, so I show up at the school to meet up with the class, without my son, expecting his Dad dropped him off like normal. Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community. This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course...

The normalcy of divorced parents is definitely regional/school dependent. Before we moved here, at our previous school it seemed very common. The teacher's were super great about working with us, saying they have many kids in similar situations. We always received 2 of every important document, just every accommodation you could think of. This new school, in this neighborhood, it doesn't seem as common. I haven't met any of my kids friend's parents that are divorced and the teachers haven't been nearly as accommodating.

Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community. This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

Thank you for all the responses!! I really appreciate it. The range of comments is very interesting. Everyone read the same post, yet responses range from ""chill out it's a simple mistake"" to ""you should change your child custody ASAP"".

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"

Thank you for all the responses!! I really appreciate it. The range of comments is very interesting.

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"
154,t3_bk0xm8,CronenbergFlippyNips,Given some of the responses in here I was starting to wonder if it was just me thinking this woman sounds like she's wound super tight. It's not the end of the world.,1,"I posted about this co-parenting dilemma a week ago or so when me kid's dad (my ex) and I both volunteered to chaperone a field trip. I was upset at having to decide to either not go or share the experience with him and the struggles of co-parenting in general. Well, let me tell you how things went! Another episode in the disaster of my life...

I ended up taking the high ground and decided to co-chaperone a group with my ex, knowing my son would be so excited to have both his parents on the field trip. I was disappointed, but it was the right thing to do. Then a couple days before, his dad said he can't go because he has an interview. I was thrilled and thought I had earned some good karma points by deciding we'd both go!

Here we are, day of the field trip. I'm so excited to have the day off from work to enjoy with my son. They are at their dads house this week, so I show up at the school to meet up with the class, without my son, expecting his Dad dropped him off like normal. Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community. This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

156,t3_bk0xm8,a_canteloupe1,"That sounds very challenging! I'm sorry your daughter has to deal with that. 

My ex is also of the narcissistic type personality and goes through waves of drinking too much. I have a feeling when my kids are old enough to decide, they will choose not to see him as much. They've already expressed to me the desire to spend more days at my house during the school weeks. But they do love their dad and love spending time with him, as little boys should. But slowly, I'm watching them become disillusioned and it's sad. They're realizing he's just full of broken promises and my 9 y/o doesn't believe what he says anymore. I do think it's important for them to have a relationship with their dad, know that he loves them, and for them to realize who each of their parents is on their own. It's very hard to know what the right then to do is.",2,"I posted about this co-parenting dilemma a week ago or so when me kid's dad (my ex) and I both volunteered to chaperone a field trip.

157,t3_bk0xm8,a_canteloupe1,"Exactly this!! I reminded him the night before, reminded him to pack his son a lunch and water (he sent one to a summer camp field trip to California adventure with AN EMPTY LUNCH BOX). I offered to pack the lunch and water if needed. I text him at 6:30 am in the morning with a reminder. My whole life is reminding him it feels like. If I don't text him on the weekend in the morning reminding about soccer and swimming lessons, there's a 50/50 chance he'll forget. And yes, it's my fault if he fails and I'm wrong for being upset that he didn't take kids to the activities.

159,t3_bk0xm8,a_canteloupe1,It's called speaking in hyperbole and trying to make a short catchy title.,2,"I posted about this co-parenting dilemma a week ago or so when me kid's dad (my ex) and I both volunteered to chaperone a field trip. I was upset at having to decide to either not go or share the experience with him and the struggles of co-parenting in general. Well, let me tell you how things went! Another episode in the disaster of my life...

I ended up taking the high ground and decided to co-chaperone a group with my ex, knowing my son would be so excited to have both his parents on the field trip. I was disappointed, but it was the right thing to do. Then a couple days before, his dad said he can't go because he has an interview. I was thrilled and thought I had earned some good karma points by deciding we'd both go!

Here we are, day of the field trip. I'm so excited to have the day off from work to enjoy with my son. They are at their dads house this week, so I show up at the school to meet up with the class, without my son, expecting his Dad dropped him off like normal. Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community. This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him.

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"
165,t3_bk0xm8,rescuesquad704,I meant the people at the school.,6,"I posted about this co-parenting dilemma a week ago or so when me kid's dad (my ex) and I both volunteered to chaperone a field trip. I was upset at having to decide to either not go or share the experience with him and the struggles of co-parenting in general. Well, let me tell you how things went! Another episode in the disaster of my life...

I ended up taking the high ground and decided to co-chaperone a group with my ex, knowing my son would be so excited to have both his parents on the field trip. I was disappointed, but it was the right thing to do. Then a couple days before, his dad said he can't go because he has an interview. I was thrilled and thought I had earned some good karma points by deciding we'd both go!

Here we are, day of the field trip. I'm so excited to have the day off from work to enjoy with my son. They are at their dads house this week, so I show up at the school to meet up with the class, without my son, expecting his Dad dropped him off like normal. Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community.

I was disappointed, but it was the right thing to do. Then a couple days before, his dad said he can't go because he has an interview. I was thrilled and thought I had earned some good karma points by deciding we'd both go!

Here we are, day of the field trip. I'm so excited to have the day off from work to enjoy with my son. They are at their dads house this week, so I show up at the school to meet up with the class, without my son, expecting his Dad dropped him off like normal. Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community. This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

EDIT:

Thank you for all the responses!! I really appreciate it. The range of comments is very interesting. Everyone read the same post, yet responses range from ""chill out it's a simple mistake"" to ""you should change your child custody ASAP"". I think it goes to show what an impact everyone's own experience has on interpretation of content!

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"
171,t3_bk0xm8,a_canteloupe1,"It's one incident in a series of events. Obviously it's not about someone sleeping through an alarm. You're right, that would be stupid. Everyone makes mistakes. 

But how many mistakes do let a person have before realizing constant ""mistakes"" represent a pattern of irresponsible behavior? Especially when said individual makes up valid sounding excuses regularly. Some are legit and some aren't... But why is it my job to sort through lies and determine the legitimacy for each excuse?

173,t3_bk0xm8,Mortlach78,"It's mainly us having to deal with it now, but yeah, daughter has been dealing with it for as long as I've been part of our family which is going on 7 years now.
Him and his new wife had a baby, which didn't help because apparently they yell at him too. Our daughter was nervous because she sees her friends with younger siblings fight and struggle so she thought that was normal. He didn't help much by promising her half-brother would not be allowed in her room and ruin her stuff, and then bring the brother to the room (and wreck stuff, as kids do). 

We also had a baby, her half-sister, but we did a LOT of prep work getting her comfortable with the idea, explaining things, reassuring her, etc, so her relationship with her sister is very good. Bio-dad there didn't help much: she was still going to his place at the time and he told her we wouldn't love her as much once the new baby arrived...  That's the kind of BS we had to deal with every time she came home after a weekend visit.

It is hard to know what is right and I think psychologists and 'gut feeling' sometimes diverge. There is something called a parental bind that kids can be in when they feel they need to chose between their parents and this basically made us try to keep their relationship going for an extra 2 years or so until it finally broke down completely.

I think it's important to listen to them, take their concerns and thoughts seriously, help them see things from a different perspective, never speak ill of the other parent. Daughter asked me once why I resort to ""diplomatic language"" when I talk about her dad and I said ""Because you might one day want to fix that relationship and if you do and I speak my mind, you'll not be able to forget what I said about him, to this is to protect you, not him.""

I am all for seeing the best in people; don't attribute to malice what can just as easily be explained by stupidity, etc. On the other hand, it is also important to not string them along. Narcissists can't self reflect and therefore can't improve their behavior. They will never be what the people around them want them to be.",2,"I posted about this co-parenting dilemma a week ago or so when me kid's dad (my ex) and I both volunteered to chaperone a field trip.

They are at their dads house this week, so I show up at the school to meet up with the class, without my son, expecting his Dad dropped him off like normal. Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community. This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"

Thank you for all the responses!! I really appreciate it. The range of comments is very interesting. Everyone read the same post, yet responses range from ""chill out it's a simple mistake"" to ""you should change your child custody ASAP"". I think it goes to show what an impact everyone's own experience has on interpretation of content!

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"
181,t3_bk0xm8,a_canteloupe1,"I feel you. I'm heavily in debt doing the right thing for my kids, at the moment. And I pay extra for rent to allow them to go to a great public school. Just not in a position to pay a lawyer anything at the moment. But knowing my salary will more than double in 1.5 years, it just makes sense to wait. What I need to do though, so make extensive notes of all his parenting failures for those 1.5 years.",8,"I posted about this co-parenting dilemma a week ago or so when me kid's dad (my ex) and I both volunteered to chaperone a field trip. I was upset at having to decide to either not go or share the experience with him and the struggles of co-parenting in general. Well, let me tell you how things went! Another episode in the disaster of my life...

I ended up taking the high ground and decided to co-chaperone a group with my ex, knowing my son would be so excited to have both his parents on the field trip. I was disappointed, but it was the right thing to do. Then a couple days before, his dad said he can't go because he has an interview. I was thrilled and thought I had earned some good karma points by deciding we'd both go!

Here we are, day of the field trip. I'm so excited to have the day off from work to enjoy with my son. They are at their dads house this week, so I show up at the school to meet up with the class, without my son, expecting his Dad dropped him off like normal. Only I get to the class to find my child isn't there!! Next thing I know, it's 15 mins past school starting and still, I'm just here ready for the zoo WITHOUT MY SON. I'm calling my ex on repeat, he isn't answering. Everyone is preparing to get on the bus. I get ahold of his step mom and she is surprised he never showed up too. We're both panicked, she leaves work to check on the house. I decide not to get on the bus and stay waiting outside the office for their arrival. 

So I sat there waiting to hear from the step mom who is like 40 mins from their house, PANICKED. I can complain about many things regarding my ex, but he's always early for things and is good about answering the phone. I just talked to him the night before about sending a bag lunch with our son, so he knew about the trip for sure...  I was so stressed they got into a car accident coming to school or that he was unresponsive/didn't wake up for a medical reason. I just sat there for the better part of an hour trying to remember to breath and not cry, while shaking because I was so worried. 

Finally, I get a call from him. This idiot slept through his alarm on the one day his son has a field trip the whole year!   On top of nearly ruining his son's day with his friends, his incompetence made me look like such a fool! Like oh there's the dumb mom who showed up to chaperone without her child!? Obviously I'm happy he's ok and the kids are ok, but what the actual fuck is wrong with this person? I try so hard to do my best for my kids. I was so prepared today. We're also new to this city and I'm desperate to make some parent friends and become a part of our school's community. This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

182,t3_bk0xm8,a_canteloupe1,"Thanks for sharing your experience. This is helpful advice. It's so hard to work with a person with a disturbed personality type. Approaching them with the same rules that society and ""neurotypical"" people follow just doesn't work in all scenarios and we just have to stumble along trying to figure out how to get the best reaction from these people. Like you said... They can't self reflection and can't improve. I think that's something I've only recently accepted. 

I've tried so many things to ""manage"" my ex and his behavior. We tried a 5 day/2 day child sharing schedule (always Fri-Sun together) and alternating each of the M-Th days so I could keep up with homework better since it was only done consistently at my house. It became this insane attempt to control his parenting behavior to the best of my ability from afar. This sounds crazy without knowing the situation... But I was trying to do the best I could for my kids. I wish I didn't agree to 50/50 custody but the state we divorced in favores that arrangement and between him manipulating/blackmailing me and not having any money while pursuing my PhD, it just didn't seem like a possibility. Finally I realized this wasn't healthy and we're on a 7 day at a time schedule. That way he needs to be fully responsible for his week and we don't need to talk every day. 

It's been... Kind of better. I'm not losing my mind constantly dealing with my ex, but it breaks my heart sometimes when my kids have a list of complaints when they get to my house (that happens every few months. His behavior goes in waves of him trying hard and doing ok and being incompetent and treating his wife like crap). Or when my ex's own sister calls me to tell me what a terrible parent he is. The kids love him and most of the time say things are fine and of course he paints himself as the dad of the year when talking to me. Nobody gives you a roadmap to handle these situations. 

But done with complaining about that! I'm now happily engaged and in June my fiance will officially be my kids step dad. We can teach them what a normal, happy marriage looks like. They have a wonderful male role model in him and know what a good father behaves like. Being a step parent doesn't look easy. It sounds like you've really stepped up to be an amazing dad to your daughter. You should be very proud!",1,"I posted about this co-parenting dilemma a week ago or so when me kid's dad (my ex) and I both volunteered to chaperone a field trip.

183,t3_bk0xm8,a_canteloupe1,"OMG you're describing my life. My ex has also forgotten who's day it is and has his wife do everything. She's nice but not the brightest and is extremely submissive, so she just does whatever thing he tells her to do... Including picking up kids on my days. There's nothing more disappointing than leaving after a stressful day at work, excited to see your kids after they've been at their dad's for days, only to show up at the daycare to pick up your kids that have already been picked up. It kills me. 

I tried moving our communication to only email, but I'm not the best at enforcing boundaries so it ended up failing. It's just so hard to disengage from worrying about the kids while they are at their dad's and to stop compensating for him. I can't get him to stop thinking we're friends, either. It's the most bizarre part. Like after the zoo debacle, I call him after to let him know how his actions negatively impact his child, me, the group I was supposed to be chaperoning, and his wife. He's like, ""I know, I know. I feel bad you don't need to tell me."" He proceedes to blame the kids for how tired he was and it's their fault he didn't wake up and it's their fault for being too scared to wake him up once they realized what time it was. And then he starts trying to talk about some great tv show he's watching and that I should watch.  I'm like wtf how does someone just think everything is so chill and that their ex-wife just wants to chat about his life!? It was so dumbfounding. 

Now that they are 7 and 9 he expects them to be responsible adults. It sucks bc every time he fails them now and I'm like dude what is going on..? His new go to response is to blame the kids.

Also, stop explaining your reasons or defending yourself because the more you say, the more options they have to latch on to some details and torpedo the entire thing.

This is already hard with working full time and now I'm the disaster mom who doesn't even know where her kids are. But my poor children have to deal with this kind of crap (it's literally always something with their dad) and I feel so helpless. Every time he does something fucked up like this, I try to think about how we can avoid it and what I can do to compensate for his incompetence, then he throws another curve ball (a completely different, new incompetent behavior). I'm SO tired of co-parenting. I'm so tired of banging my head against the wall just trying to give my kids a normal life. 

Why is it so hard??? 

TLDR: I'm divorced and co-parent 2 boys with my ex (50/50). I showed up to chaperone my son's field trip and his dad never brought him to school. After an hour of being unable to get ahold of him and panicking at the school while feeling like an idiot, turns out my ex slept through his alarm this morning and was asleep.

EDIT:

Thank you for all the responses!! I really appreciate it. The range of comments is very interesting. Everyone read the same post, yet responses range from ""chill out it's a simple mistake"" to ""you should change your child custody ASAP"". I think it goes to show what an impact everyone's own experience has on interpretation of content!

I know it's hard to formulate a good opinion when you only have a small window (1 post) into their life. So here's some more fun facts for you to work with. My ex is 12 years older than me, we started dating when I was 19 and he was 31. I had my oldest when I was 21. My ex is narcissistic and has a drinking problem, this relationship was very emotionally abusive. I had to pull some shady moves to get out of that relationship, including tricking him into moving across the country to be near my parents then filing a temporary restraining order to get him out (kids were 3.5 years and 18 mo). That being said, he loves his kids. He didn't leave and go back home across country. He went into anger management and AA. None of it stuck of course... Anyways the people telling me to revisit custody are on the right track. 

No doubt I'll be critiqued now for allowing my kids to be with this toxic person. But life is hard and the right choice isn't clear. I think having a ""bad Dad"" that you know loves you is better than having your mom try to cut your ""bad Dad"" out of your life. Keep in mind that I talk to my ex almost daily still and half of what he says to me is a lie. Despite it all... Somehow I fucking believe when he talks to me. I have empathy for him and his life situation and I'm still manipulated for it. That's a lot of the frustration I have towards him. So before deciding someone isn't dealing with a situation properly or thinking their overreacting, you should consider that you don't know the whole situation and it could be a lot more complicated than you think!"

204,t3_aukot5,ritathecat,"For a short period of time, I was an opening teacher in a two year old classroom. I knew all the kids who got there before the regular teachers, and this is what I observed: he may not be building a bond with the teacher because she is in the room for such a short amount of time. It could be something as simple as that. When I opened in that class, there were a couple of children who had a hard time at drop off, simply because I didn't spend enough time in the classroom to be able to build a bond with them. The only other time I was in there was to give the regular teachers their lunches and the kids were usually napping at that point. 

He could be confused because the teachers he spends the majority of his day with are not there. Maybe you could make it a point to sound a little more excited when you walk into the classroom and see that teacher. Help your child be excited to see her, too. I know it's hard on you to see your son sad. After some time, I'm sure he gets better after he's been dropped off and the day gets going. Moments like this are also hard on the teacher, too.

From what you have described, your partner is an out of control multi substance addict who has been wreaking havoc in your home for a long time.

No strategy will be effective until the trauma stops. This child’s behavior seems very serious to me, and you are running out of time before the damage becomes lasting.

Call the police if she gets into a car drunk/stoned

Keep photos and screenshots of incriminating texts

219,t3_aowm98,klekota,"Indeed all very concerning. I had moved out with the child for several months.  We were both in a healthy and supportive place.  We moved back under the guise that my spouse was seeking help, its turned out not to be the case.  Things have changed since then and the jurisdiction we live in has very unfavorable legal rules that make it extremely challenging right now to do anything.  If I make any moves, our child will most likely be 50/50 in each home. Currently I am the only shield that, albeit inadequately, is able to protect our child in any meaningful way.  The child is with me 99% of the time and is not alone with said spouse and I care for them in almost every facet.  Until I am able to work out a way to truly be able to take the child out of the situation, I am finding it extremely difficult to execute anything that will, I feel, abandon my child.  For one, this child relies on me for everything.  Its been this way for the past two years.  As the stable and consistent parent, having me out of the picture will create more harm.  Secondly, I fear what will go on behind closed doors, without me as a buffer.  I know from experience nothing good will come from that environment and will also harm the child. 

&#x200B;

Knowing all of this, I am trying to navigate our child into some type of grounded place where they can express their emotions without inflicted self harm upon themselves.  I do understand the environment is the cause of this.

224,t3_aowm98,wanderer333,"> I am very concerned that this is a sign of a more serious emotional problem, anxiety, etc.

Well yes, as you have alluded to in your post, this is likely a sign of a very distressed toddler who is being traumatized by witnessing verbal abuse on a regular basis, and it sounds like also receiving corporal punishment which is completely inappropriate for a 2yo (or really any age, in my opinion).  The solution here is not to focus on the symptom (self-harming), but to actually solve the underlying problem (get out of the abusive situation).

In the meantime though, yes, encourage your toddler to redirect the energy in healthy ways (hitting a pillow, stomping feet, shaking a “calming jar” (google for how to make one), etc).  I also suggest consulting a counselor about how this situation is affecting both you and your child.",9,"I have a two year old child who has developed a habit of self harming over the past 6 months.

226,t3_aowm98,pimllama,I think stomping and yelling is a wonderful outlet. Again I am no expert... Just kinda winging it really and it seems like it might just be part of being a small human.

227,t3_aowm98,muscari,"I know a toddler that pulls/eats hair but it appears to be a phase related to separation anxiety. Given all the other info you've provided, this doesn't sound like 'just a phase'.  I'd be concerned for my child's wellbeing too if this were our family dynamic. These are the formative years for your child's emotional, cognitive, social, and physical development, so you're 100% correct in thinking repeated exposure to traumatic events can have negative consequences. I'm really more concerned about your partner's parenting since as you point out yourself, your toddler's behaviour is likely triggered by it. The overwhelming (and research-backed) consensus on corporal punishment is that it's ineffective and harmful in the longterm (eg. Kids are more likely to develop a mental disorder).  I think if you've offered alternative discipline methods and your spouse continually defends corporal punishment, then let this be their hill to die on and get out. Spanking, arguments, and unhappy parents don't contribute towards turning our kids into a happy, well-adjusted adults, and the self-harming is likely an early warning sign that he/she is not coping well.

228,t3_aowm98,whoop_there_she_is,"That's good, and i understand its a tough spot for you. Without knowing those details it's probably difficult to impossible to treat the effects of abuse. You can divert the child's attention away from the unwanted behavior (biting themselves) but you can't prevent an abused child from reacting naturally from that abuse. I would have more sympathy and more leeway. 

Have you called CPS/police on every occassion of abuse and collected all evidence for court?

233,t3_aowm98,whoop_there_she_is,"I would call CPS *today*. They have so many resources, you don't even know. Their goal is to keep children with their families, not to take kids away. They can also be an advocate, give free therapy and parenting sessions, and be your greatest supporter in a divorce court. I'm very surprised you havent been given that advice from lawyers before. *Always* call CPS when children are being abused.

My other advice is to know your rights as a parent. As an example, you can take your child and yourself to a hotel *any time* abuse is eminent. You have that right as a parent. Escaping violence both physical and abusive is a great way to show authorities that you are committed to protecting your child. Staying to ""hash it out/wait it out"", on the other hand, is harmful. The authorities should have a running tab every time spouse goes off the rails, any time they're using drugs around the kids (any time they're doing drugs period!) and every time they threaten/enact violence against your child or yourself. It's hard to lose in court with a binder full of police and CPS reports showing your spouse to be a violent addict. It's very sad your lawyers never said anything.",3,"I have a two year old child who has developed a habit of self harming over the past 6 months.

A tantrum is usually caused by him not getting what he wants: into the kitchen, a cell phone, full dedicated attention from mom (who has a newborn).

274,t3_7o75km,mrsfantastico,"My oldest was speach delayed. He recieved developmental, occupational and speach therapy. He didn't point, make eye contact or answer to his name when they first tested him and his first words didn't come until about 3 years old. One of his first words was ""water"" so he would use ""water"" for everything. One day he didn't want to leave gymnastics, so he started screaming the word ""water"" at the top of his lungs over and over again. Of course we tried to give him actual water but that was not what he wanted. He didn't want to leave. So here we are the most awful parents in the world forcing our baby into his car seat while depriving this poor child of the ""water"" he's screaming and kicking for. 

The kid is almost 9 now and I gotta tell you he will not shut up. He's at the top of his class and has lost all of his classifications.

I started crying pretty much immediately and freaked him out at first with all of my ""yes that's right! Mama! I'm mama! Mama!""  But now he has said it two more times.

My first born struggled a little with forming words. He was ready to talk, he wanted to communicate, but the mouth part just didn't work out for him in the beginning. We used baby sign language for important words, starting with stuff babies love, like a sign for light on/off. He took up signing quickly and it stopped him from becoming frustrated.

310,t3_7o75km,kokey,"I think there's a lot of confusion with concerns over speech delays because 'not talking' is really an overly simplistic shorthand for communication related delays.  It's usually only an issue if there's a delay in receptive language, in order words if the child doesn't seem to understand, notice, or react to things that are said.  Speaking follows on from listening and knowing that sounds are used for communication.  If children seem to look at faces, notice when their name is called and even act like they understand and follow some instructions but doesn't say anything yet then it's perfectly within normal range not to say much at 17 months.  They tend to catch up with talking around the 18-22 month mark but later than that is also not unusual.",7,"I have three kids, ages 4 (Emily) 2.5 (Hazel) and 16 months (Owen).

311,t3_7o75km,saltinthewind,"Not unless there are other issues, as OP mentioned. My daughter had a severe burst eardrum just after her first birthday and the doc said I’d have to keep an eye on her speech development. By 16-17 months I had put her on the wait list for a hearing test because the wait list here is crazy long (I still wasn’t really too concerned by this stage as she’s the youngest of three, only booked it because of her ear issues) and by the time they rang us when she was 18-19 months she was using 2-3 word sentences. Now she’s just over 2 and never stops. My advice (as an early years teacher and a Mum) is to model language as much as you can, even when you feel like a douche. With all of my kids, we would walk around the shops and point to everything we saw so I’d be walking along going ‘that’s a mango, there’s a pineapple, I wonder what that is? Oh it’s a pear’ etc. Also, read read read!! Reading to your kids is the best way of teaching and encouraging language.

Sooooo we were sent to a speech therapist and all that: my reaction was “I’ve never seen a 2 year old that could use 200 words, let alone use them correctly. What do they want, a college dissertation by 3?” Meanwhile my wife is automatically assumed we were failures as parents. 

For the most part, kids talk when they want to. Obviously there’s exceptions and real difficulties. But as I told my wife at one point “what are you afraid of? That she’ll be in high school pointing at shit and saying ‘eeeeehhh’ to her teacher?”

I don’t know what your qualifications or experience are with the topic, but what you said resonates with my experience with my son. 
 
He is 25 months and doesn’t say a whole lot...less than ten discernible words or phrases. But he babbles and points NON STOP.  He always lets me know exactly what he wants by grabbing my hand and pulling me where he wants me to be. He understands everything I say to him. I tell him it’s time to change his diaper, and he lays down on the floor. I tell him it’s time for bed, he grabs his blanket and heads for the stairs. He plays well with his big sister (age 4). He listens to commands very well. 

He seems to know what he’s saying when he babbles although we don’t. His ped isn’t terribly concerned because he has such great comprehension but will explore speech therapy for us if that’s what we want to do. I don’t think he really needs it. I feel the ability to say what he wants to say is in there somewhere, it just has to click for him. I think there will be an explosion of words when he’s finally ready. But I definitely feel an intense external pressure to get him evaluated.

She's very communicative with body language and we can tell she understands us to a large degree but the not actually speaking words had us worried as it was getting pretty late.

The best thing we did was talk to a couple professionals and stick to their advice. And now we're getting new words in her vocabulary every few days.

378,t3_7o75km,kokey,"I mainly have my experience with my son who is 4 years and diagnosed as high functioning autistic so we went through a fair bit of learning about how this develops normally and with autistic and hyperlexic kids.

People often tried to make us feel less concerned by telling us about other kids who started 'talking late', but the same people think we can just tell our son 'no' to stay away from things when he's never responded, even with a glance, to a single spoken word.  Then these people try for themselves to get his attention and it's like he's deaf. 

We also know people with shy kids or who only talk selectively to some people and they tell us about the pressures they feel from some people about their kids 'not talking' when the behaviour and receptive language comprehension of those kids is like on a totally different level to ours.  I have noticed the people who think this is a problem, or have some kind of difficulty with children like this, are people who find attention and recognition of themselves as important.   They are the kind of people who would double down if they don't get the response they want and over their life developed a lot of ways to get attention and also are used to mostly guaranteed ways to get attention and interaction from children.   So when a child snubs them like that they act like someone who has been rejected and goes through various phases of grief or something, including suggesting that something is wrong with the child.

From what I've seen some boys just take longer to talk, especially if they started walking early, have a fairly chatty older sibling and don't have a lot of frustration of not getting things they want done without asking for it and pointing and grunting works out just fine.  If they understand everything then it's usually more than fine.",5,"I have three kids, ages 4 (Emily) 2.5 (Hazel) and 16 months (Owen).

395,t3_a63xa5,ImCryingRealTears,"Sorry, this won't be helpful, but I really felt the need to let you know I am absolutely in awe of what you've done. There are more than enough step-parents in the world who just want to take a big step back from their partners kids, and not nearly enough who can or do step up (no pun intended), to genuinely love and care for someone else's child. I understand that every family is different, and not every situation is ideal, but I always appreciate the parents and step-parents who can put aside personal differences and unify to raise the children, and honey you are owning that like a true queen.

Seriously, though, Holy god damn, you've done more for that boy in the last two years than it sounds like anyone has done for him in the 12 before that. You should be so proud of yourself for seeing the things that everyone else was ignoring or unable to see. He won't see it for a little while, in fact, he may resent you a little for the drastic changes and all the tests he's had to go through, but having his eye sight, hearing, and ASD medically identified, acknowledged and actively resolved/treated will go so far towards improving his quality of life. He may just have to grow up a little more before he starts to see it and wake up to how he's acting. 

According to my mother, MIL and ex-MIL, a lot of teenage boys apparently are just like that. They hit puberty, turn feral, and spend 10-ish years buzzing on hormones waiting for their brain to finish developing. It's no one's fault, they just have no idea how to navigate the business of growing up. Having medical issues complicating everything isn't helpful either. 

What you need is a chill out zone. Just a room or a corner of your home that is yours, and filled with calming things. Your favourite book, a CD player and your favourite album, a pretty plant, a lovely smelling candle, a stash of chocolate, a bottle of red (or maybe some vodka) a comfy chair or cushion or bean bag or rug or whatever. Just stuff that is yours and will help you block out the world for a bit each day, so you have the mental capacity to step back into the real world and take on it's challenges. Then practice leaving work at work, home at home, and bringing nothing into your chill out zone. And make an appointment for your own therapist. They'll be able to give you tools to relieve your anxiety. Sorry I can't be helpful, but stay kick ass, love your boys fiercely, and I hope everything turns out ok for you xx

Update: I just remembered these two really great resources I was linked to last week. I've been taking a parenting course, as I've been struggling with my 5yo daughter's sudden anger issues, and the ladies running the course directed me to these websites, and there's some pretty fantastic advice. They're Australian resources, but I hope they're relevant for you.

",11,"I'm broken. I don't know what to do. My 14y/o stepson is just so vile to me. Despite me being the one that helps support his needs with school and the various medical institutions we deal with, he is rude, aggressive and disrespectful. We had such a wonderful relationship as he grew up and we love each other dearly (that's not in question) but he's destroying it. So much so, I struggle terribly when he's around and I suffer anxiety and in some cases, I border on panic attacks. My husband is supportive, but I appreciate he's between a rock and a hard place. We never argued at all before my SS came to live with us, but now he's causing so much friction and sadness, it makes me feel like I'm failing everyone, most of all my 7 year old biological son who is picking up his awful behaviour and has been affected by his influence.

A bit of background...

I have a 7 y/o biological son and a 14y/o Stepson who I've known since he was 4. Two years ago my stepson came to live with us due to his physically disabled mum struggling with his temper tantrums. I suggested he come to live with us at this point, as he was finishing junior school and he clearly needed his Dad at this point to help him through puberty etc. We are all very much a parental unit his mum, my husband and I, and discussing his needs, a fresh start for him would be beneficial and help steer his life in the right direction. 

Once agreed, I sorted a school in two weeks for him. I'd arranged support at school as he is dyspraxic and struggled on other levels too. I basically sorted everything so that the move for him was as seamless and smooth as it could be. 

It became apparent after the honeymooning period was over that there were a lot of issues which we didn't realise were so bad. Firstly, his eyesight was awful and in the past refused to wear glasses, so I got this sorted. After a few months, it was apparent that he was struggling to hear people. His mum and dad put it down to his dyspraxia and his inability to process things at a normal pace, but it was obvious to me that he was simply not hearing. I took him to the doctors and after we were referred to the audiologists, we discovered he had moderate permanent hearing loss in both ears and will have to wear hearing aids for the rest of his life.  The biggest issue was that he had regular full-blown 'meltdowns' over nothing and was a deeply sad boy. These became so bad that he was trashing my house multiple times a week and trying to hurt himself by banging his head off the wall. In the end, we had to have him referred to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) due to his worrying behaviour. 

Long story, short. He had a one to one psychiatrist and we had family therapy which was requested in order to help support my 7-year-old but he wasn't even included. It was obvious to us that he was struggling in other ways and when the therapy finished and trauma from being bullied at school was lifted, his autistic traits became very clear. I spent all of my time and energy into helping him find out why he behaved as he did and so we went through the process of getting him assessed for ASD. Many emails, calls and meetings later, after 2 years in July, our thoughts were confirmed and he was diagnosed with having moderate ASD. 

In the past 18 months, school has been a struggle. He's rude and obnoxious towards the teachers - no respect whatsoever. He's getting multiple detentions a week for behaviour and forgotten homework. He's refusing to eat properly at school, choosing to buy multiple cakes over a proper meal. He's compulsively lying to everyone around him. And despite sitting him down so many times to discuss his behaviour, he just doesn't care. 

Being so involved in his life and treating him as my own is destroying me. I can't walk away and I wouldn't walk away, but I am a shell. I'm so emotional and having him around me makes me feel like I have a ball of emotional energy in my chest. I get headaches as I near home from work due to the stress it's causing me. I am at a loss and other than my husband (who I feel awful being so honest to) I have no support.

To make matters worse, my 7y/o son is struggling at the moment and the school are assessing him for ADHD and this breaks my heart. Especially having gone through 2 years of hell for my SS's ASD diagnosis. I'm plodding along in robotic fashion, but I don't know for how much longer I can continue on this path. Work is an escape for me and home feels like torture at times. I want to be able to feel happy and relaxed in my own domain. 

I have days where I feel like upping and leaving, but I couldn't do that to my husband and son. I feel trapped and I just want to 'fix' things, but feel like I have nowhere to turn.

If anyone can offer any help and advice, I would really appreciate it.

I am at a loss and other than my husband (who I feel awful being so honest to) I have no support.

To make matters worse, my 7y/o son is struggling at the moment and the school are assessing him for ADHD and this breaks my heart. Especially having gone through 2 years of hell for my SS's ASD diagnosis. I'm plodding along in robotic fashion, but I don't know for how much longer I can continue on this path. Work is an escape for me and home feels like torture at times. I want to be able to feel happy and relaxed in my own domain. 

I have days where I feel like upping and leaving, but I couldn't do that to my husband and son. I feel trapped and I just want to 'fix' things, but feel like I have nowhere to turn.

If anyone can offer any help and advice, I would really appreciate it.

397,t3_9je6gl,lemonzezt,"Clearly she has certain traits in her temperament that are extreme and in conflict. This could be, for example, high activity level and high persistence (based on the 10 traits described in ""Understanding Temperament"" a fantastic parenting book.) The idea is to identify the extremes and start teaching DISCIPLINE through games and activities while she's calm and receptive. I realize 2 isn't quite a talkative age, however they certainly understand language far more than they can speak it, so it's worth it to start teaching some meditation, or taking her through some simple breathing routines you can use to distract her from the meltdown which obviously has a payoff, Sounds to me that she needs to blow off extra energy and gets carried away with the release, so pay as little attention to the behaviour your dislike as possible, and switch into the breathing activity or discipline game you've practiced. Hopefully she catches on that it's the better way to behave, because mom and dad are into it.",4,"Hi all! 
I’ve been looking around on here under “tantrums” and whatnot and I can’t seem to find any insight to what my situation is. I have a two year old little girl and here’s some background into her personality. She’s very strong willed and her doctor lets us know that every time we are there. Since my daughter was about 16 months old, she has hit herself a lot when she’s mad. Or pulls her hair out. She’s always been a biter as well. When she’s sweet, she’s incredibly sweet. She also plays very well with other children! She only is like this with me and her father. I have mentioned this twice to her pedi and she just tells me it’s a phase. 


She however has been throwing the absolute worst tantrums I’ve ever personally seen these last few months. I know, most parents say this I’m sure. For example, she was happy and playful at daycare, and the second I walked into the classroom she hugged me and then she started LOSING it. I mean literally out of nowhere. Banging her head on the tile, pulling her hair out, trying to bite me, etc. She was refusing to get in the car to go home, so I tried to pick her up and she dug her nails into my face so hard and cut me so bad that I have a huge scab on my face. She tried biting my arms, neck, face, you name it. I broke down crying because everyone was staring and I was so embarrassed. Thankfully another mother from the daycare came over and offered to help me calm her down.  



Since then, she has done this like 5 more times. The tantrums or “meltdowns” last about 45 minutes or so. She screams at the top of her lungs, and nothing calms her down. I offer her a hug, food, drink, toys, even my phone or her tablet and it still doesn’t work. She will randomly do this with no reason or trigger that I know of.

I’m really trying to stay off of google, because I looked on there night and I just keep reading articles about autistic meltdowns, anxiety, ADHD, and it’s just making me worried sick. 
Someone give me some insight. Either share a similar experience so I’m not alone, or guide me on what this could possibly be. I’m going to put in a call to her pedi again tonight after work. "
398,t3_9je6gl,Emotional_Nebula,"So, there are some valid comcerns that you've noticed, and her pediatrician has noted some concerns as well. Have you asked your pediatrician for a referral to a developmental pediatrician?

The other thing I would recommend, if you have not already done it, is to complete the MCHAT screening. It's 20 questions to be completed by the parent, and you score it yourself. It can tell you if your child screens ""at risk"" and whether that level of risk warrants further evaluation. Your MCHAT results should be shared with your pediatrician. It's a very accurate tool for spotting things like autism and other developmental issues from 16-30 months of age:

https://m-chat.org/en-us/page/take-m-chat-test/online

The other option, in addition to the above, is to get Early Intervention involved. Your local Birth to Three Early Intervention program will come to you and perform a free evaluation to determine if your daughter requires services. Services like Occupational Therapy, Speech Therapy, and Physical Therapy are provided in your home or at your child's daycare eith free or at low cost to you, if your child qualifies.",4,"Hi all!

Two year olds have really just discovered that they can change the way you act and respond by doing different things. As such, LOTS of two year olds engage in distrusting seeming or extreme behaviors. 

If they seem to be firing up when you arrive, and they are continuing, pay attention to your reaction and do the opposite for a month. Be aware that if you don’t respond the way she wants, the tantrum may get even worse THAT day, but if you stay strong and don’t react they will reduce over the next week or two. ",1,"Hi all!

**LO's doctor's appointment**
I came home to a completely fed up husband. He tells me that our son has violently hitting his head all morning and that he wasn't going to accept teething for a reason. I asked him if he's going to help me push for an answer and he agrees. My son is literally banging on his head crying up until the moment leave. He takes a nap and the car and wakes as the happiest child ever. He's doctor came and asked why we were here today and my husband tell him ""He keeps hitting his head, I know is isn't an ear infection or teething. It's been going on way to long. My son hitting his head as gotten progressively worst in the past few months. It started a tapping and playing with his ear randomly, to only when he's upset but still fairly gentle, to upset and looking painful.

His doctor starting examining him ""ears look good"", ""good eye contract"" and ""oh you communicate so well. My son was sitting there babbling away. He sit down and says ""I know y'all aren't going to say it but he's not autistic. He makes eye contact and autistic kids don't do that. This is probably just a thing he does"". He starts going over milestones. All the physical ones my husband and I quickly say yeah he does that but when he asked about peek a boo. I tell him no and my husband say yeah he's never been into that. He knows you're still there. Then his doctor asked if our son knew the difference between his parents and strangers and before we get to answer he say I don't think he's every met a stranger. We start telling him about how our son will try to leave Walmart with anyone and everyone. He sees people waking and just starts following them. I never ask about my other concerns and we walk out with ""he just does that"".

**After the appointment**
As soon as we get in the car my husband asks if autistic kids beat on their heads. I told him sometime and asks if he wants a second opinion. He nods and says I just don't know any other doctors around here we would bring him to. Of course, I get home and look up early intervention. it seems like all the places a could find on our state's site where surrounding the capital (4 hours away) the closest one was 2 hours away but said on the site their resources are limited and the can not promise to be able to evaluate every kid that applies. Without his doctor on my side it sounds like this may be a tough road.

I came out that doctor's appointment a little relieved but also more confused. All my son's other behaviors I can accept has ""just sometime he does"" but the fact that he seems in distress while hitting his head is too stressful to ignore. I feel like there's a million other reason besides ear infection, autism and just sometime he does and the fact that he doctor didn't put much effort to figure it out bothers me. He's doctor never helps with my concerns. My son doesn't sleep well, get over it, My son doesn't eat well,get over it. Oh and the fact my son hasn't gain weight in 3 months wasn't addressed from his doctor's standpoint it's probably fine but as a mother dealing with a kid who hates food there's a lot of fear involved.

**mini update** 
I have an acquaintance who’s son has sensory processing disorder as well as other development problems so I got the name and number of the doctor she uses.  Plan to make an appointment tomorrow. Right now I’m focusing on finding a cause for his head banging whatever it may be and get pointed into the right direction for finding Early intervention programs near us.  "
412,t3_7yz4q5,ScannerBrightly,"> ""I know y'all aren't going to say it but he's not autistic. He makes eye contact and autistic kids don't do that. This is probably just a thing he does""

Yeah, no. My 4 year old has been diagnosed ASD, and she's pretty good at eye contact if she needs it. The real key for us was that she just couldn't care less what other kids (or adults) are doing. She's playing with her Fiona doll, someone brings out a huge new playset or something, she doesn't even look up. You can tell she knows about it (now that she's 4, she'll answer questions about it directly) but just really seems to not care. 

She doesn't hit her head, but she does hand flapping sometimes, when very excited. 

What I suggest is find your local ""Department of Developmental Services"" (in California, called 'regional centers') and make an appointment. You often do not need to be referred, as your questions are often enough for them to give your kid a once over.  Getting diagnosed opens doors for services your kid might need or enjoy. It's helped us.",106,"first of all. I didn't think my post would get nearly that much attention. Thank you everybody for your support.

414,t3_7yz4q5,nowetbread,"You can use response blocking for the head banging behavior.  Follow him around with a pillow and put it in between him and the surface he is banging on.  This doesn't end the behavior, but it does make is safer.   Try to give him a non-compatible activity.  Have him jump or dance or something he can't head bang while doing.  If that doesn't work, you can redirect him to a sensory activity. Make a sensory box (just a shoebox with fun textured items) to redirect him to .  You can have all different types of boxes, soft, rough, squishy , etc.  Try dumping items on him to distract him from banging.  I have used a bag of fun textured balls or feathers or cotton balls over the child's head to distract from the behavior and redirect.

424,t3_7yz4q5,Crafty_mom,"My son was diagnosed at 3 and he was showing signs as early as 18-24 months. He would bang his head aggressively on the floor whenever anyone tried to say “Hi” to him. He would literally stop in the middle of a store and start beating his head on the floor and scream “ouch!” 

He was always playing with his ears too, and no ear issues were found. Playing with his ears was his sensory outlet, and something he did as young as 8 months. 

He had some eye contact, but the thing our diagnosing psychologist mentioned is that he was looking in proximity but not actual eye contact, like the bridge of our nose/ very fleeting. Not an engaging eye contact. 

One thing I’ve learnt about our process for diagnosis is that you have to advocate for your son. I would definitely seek a second opinion. I am surprised that the Pediatrician thought he could make that assessment in the 20 minutes he spent with your kid. He should have referred you to a diagnostic clinic. 

We’ve been through the process twice (for both our children) and they were with our sons for a full 8 hour day to fully experience the spectrum of their behaviour. It’s shouldn’t be just a quick visit. Its about seeing how they engage, and the child’s thought processing when you’re engaging the kiddo in different ways. 

It’s good that your spouse is on board. Early intervention is the key. Depending on the sons age there may be school services provided for early intervention. We are in Canada, and because of our sons varying delays he was able to start pre-k at age three and had access to therapists before we had diagnosis. The school actually helped set up and push the process because they were able to see the issues and vouched for our concerns.

Right now I’m focusing on finding a cause for his head banging whatever it may be and get pointed into the right direction for finding Early intervention programs near us.  "
425,t3_7yz4q5,FullofContradictions,"ANECDOTE AHEAD: For what it’s worth, I had a friend in high school who compulsively rocked if he wasn’t paying attention or was in a music class. I actually hung out at his parents house sometimes and they said it started when he was a baby banging his head on his high chair. He turned out completely normal and functional. Maybe a little different, but not in the weird way... it was in the way that actually made him pretty popular and cool at my school. He was funny and had a decent grip on all social skills. He’s a cool guy and very musically gifted. I lost track of him, but I think he ended up going to college for geology. 
  
I think the final diagnosis his family settled on was ADHD - but he was never actually medicated for it. 
 

I am aware this doesn’t mean that your child doesn’t have autism, but I figured it might be helpful if you heard about someone who exhibited similar behaviors and didn’t end up being on the spectrum.",4,"first of all.

**LO's doctor's appointment**
I came home to a completely fed up husband. He tells me that our son has violently hitting his head all morning and that he wasn't going to accept teething for a reason. I asked him if he's going to help me push for an answer and he agrees. My son is literally banging on his head crying up until the moment leave. He takes a nap and the car and wakes as the happiest child ever. He's doctor came and asked why we were here today and my husband tell him ""He keeps hitting his head, I know is isn't an ear infection or teething. It's been going on way to long. My son hitting his head as gotten progressively worst in the past few months. It started a tapping and playing with his ear randomly, to only when he's upset but still fairly gentle, to upset and looking painful.

His doctor starting examining him ""ears look good"", ""good eye contract"" and ""oh you communicate so well. My son was sitting there babbling away. He sit down and says ""I know y'all aren't going to say it but he's not autistic. He makes eye contact and autistic kids don't do that. This is probably just a thing he does"". He starts going over milestones. All the physical ones my husband and I quickly say yeah he does that but when he asked about peek a boo. I tell him no and my husband say yeah he's never been into that. He knows you're still there. Then his doctor asked if our son knew the difference between his parents and strangers and before we get to answer he say I don't think he's every met a stranger. We start telling him about how our son will try to leave Walmart with anyone and everyone. He sees people waking and just starts following them. I never ask about my other concerns and we walk out with ""he just does that"".

**After the appointment**
As soon as we get in the car my husband asks if autistic kids beat on their heads. I told him sometime and asks if he wants a second opinion. He nods and says I just don't know any other doctors around here we would bring him to. Of course, I get home and look up early intervention. it seems like all the places a could find on our state's site where surrounding the capital (4 hours away) the closest one was 2 hours away but said on the site their resources are limited and the can not promise to be able to evaluate every kid that applies. Without his doctor on my side it sounds like this may be a tough road.

I came out that doctor's appointment a little relieved but also more confused. All my son's other behaviors I can accept has ""just sometime he does"" but the fact that he seems in distress while hitting his head is too stressful to ignore. I feel like there's a million other reason besides ear infection, autism and just sometime he does and the fact that he doctor didn't put much effort to figure it out bothers me. He's doctor never helps with my concerns. My son doesn't sleep well, get over it, My son doesn't eat well,get over it. Oh and the fact my son hasn't gain weight in 3 months wasn't addressed from his doctor's standpoint it's probably fine but as a mother dealing with a kid who hates food there's a lot of fear involved.

426,t3_7yz4q5,istara,"Ultimately you know that something is wrong with your kid. It doesn't matter whether it's autism or anything else. As humans, I think we can sense when someone is not neurotypical. Before the word autism ever came into common parlance I remember three different kids at each of my schools who were *different* - two girls, one boy. It's now clear to me that they were almost certainly autistic, but there was no real diagnosis for that (or not that I heard of) back in the UK in the 1980s.

The point is that the rest of us kids knew, at some subconscious level, that these kids were ""not quite like"" us. They weren't bullied, in fact if anything people were more protective towards them. But we knew. And you are not a medical professional, *but you know*. 

So find another doctor. Get referrals to a specialist. Get the early intervention that your son probably needs, that will give him the best chances going forward.",6,"first of all.

427,t3_7yz4q5,UndedicatedSith,"Early intervention is called different things from state to state (even from county to county) which can be annoying to find all the information needed. Here's a good website to find the correct people to contact: http://ectacenter.org/contact/ptccoord.asp. 

I've had my daughter evaluated in two different states and in my experience to receive services, you do need to have a medical reason, but you can refer yourself to get an evaluation (which if he fails, he will then receive services). Definitely call your local office to confirm everything. I found the websites to be super vague and sometimes misleading like most government websites. 

When they evaluate your son, they will just ask a bunch of questions off a checklist basically, ask about his day to day behavior/schedule, and observe him doing age appropriate tasks. It sounds like you guys sort go back and forth with answers and don't sound very sure. I would suggest you start writing down all problematic behaviors down as they occur and how long they occur. Problematic behaviors would be behaviors that impair his ability to function in a normal day to day schedule. So his head banging would count, but his lining up his toys would only count if he got overly frustrated/mad if it got ruined, concentrated for an extended period of time, etc.

They problem with your doctor is that a lot of common signs of children with sensory processing disorder, autism, etc are also common among typically growing toddlers. They though will usually grow out of them or it doesn't impair them to point of it being consider a disability. So it's important for you guys to be able to articulate how it's a major concern vs first time parents being overly worried.",3,"first of all.

428,t3_7yz4q5,mrsfantastico,"My eldest was in early intervention and they were wonderful. They asked my the basics during evaluation, eye contact, respond to name, etc and while I'm telling them yeah he does all that, they showed me that no he wasn't. I'd definitely call and talk to them for an evaluation and get an idea of what that timeline would be. In the meantime, you need a new pediatrician. Get into local Facebook mom groups and ask around for recommendations. See who is good with possible processing/behavioral issues. Try to get an appointment with a pediatric neurologist. Here the ped. neurologist apt and/or diagnosis is gold and they would be able to pin point what could be causing these behaviors. You all need some help and someone who won't just brush you off.  Head banging like that is not a typical childhood behavior. Best of luck to you and your family on this journey. It's not an easy one but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. ",3,"first of all.

My son hitting his head as gotten progressively worst in the past few months. It started a tapping and playing with his ear randomly, to only when he's upset but still fairly gentle, to upset and looking painful.

His doctor starting examining him ""ears look good"", ""good eye contract"" and ""oh you communicate so well. My son was sitting there babbling away. He sit down and says ""I know y'all aren't going to say it but he's not autistic. He makes eye contact and autistic kids don't do that. This is probably just a thing he does"".

Without his doctor on my side it sounds like this may be a tough road.

I came out that doctor's appointment a little relieved but also more confused.

I feel like there's a million other reason besides ear infection, autism and just sometime he does and the fact that he doctor didn't put much effort to figure it out bothers me.

436,t3_7yz4q5,Ninja_Platypus,"Everyone has given great advice, especially about early intervention. My 3rd child just finished first steps. 2/3 of my kids have autism, all needed speech services. It's amazing. You are his advocate, fight for him.

I also just wanted to say I know the wondering is maddening. Y'all want answers and at the same time don't. No one wants to hear there's something different about thier baby. Just know this- your child is the same child today you held in your arms the first time. He will still be your same baby next week and next month, and even if they give him a label- he's still that same child. A label just helps you find the right doors to open on his journey. Be with him every step. It gets easier, it gets harder.

Tell the pediatrician you want a referral for testing. Let the testing tell you what's what. And rather than being led by questions, detail all of the concerning behaviors you have witnessed. Make a list and bring it with you to the appointment.

My (older) child was diagnosed with ADHD. The parent/teacher surveys we filled out, which are a primary tool for a diagnosis, were borderline. Apparently it was questionable that my child didn't have super negative behaviors associated with ADHD (fighting, lying, stealing, etc.)

What clinched the diagnosis was a page I brought with me where I'd typed up several common scenarios, in detail, that contrasted my child's behavior with the behavior of other kids in certain situations.

439,t3_7yz4q5,Ishouldbeasleepnow,"Hugs. Sounds like you’re getting lots of good advice. I would 100% keep reaching out to a new pedi. & keep pushing for a diagnosis or at least testing. 

One thing I will add is there’s a lot you can start doing at home if you suspect asd or spd. As I’ve heard it, most asd kids have spd. Not all spd kids have asd. One can mascarade as the other. If a kid is majorly overwhelmed by spd issues his social interactions can suffer as a result. 

I would recommend reading ‘the Out of sync child’ as a starting point. It details the various areas of spd & will give you a solid understanding of what could be going on. If nothing else it will give you a good vocabulary to talk with clinicians going forward. 

There’s also SO MANY good resources online. Things like the Star Institute and lots & lots of blogs. I’m not saying blogs are to be used instead of professionals, but while you are waiting for the appointments it can be good to start reading through what problems other parents have faced & how they have solved them. 

So much good luck your way. Keep advocating for your kid. And if he’s still non verbal, maybe consider adding sign language? It really helped both my spd kids. ",1,"first of all.

**LO's doctor's appointment**
I came home to a completely fed up husband. He tells me that our son has violently hitting his head all morning and that he wasn't going to accept teething for a reason. I asked him if he's going to help me push for an answer and he agrees. My son is literally banging on his head crying up until the moment leave. He takes a nap and the car and wakes as the happiest child ever. He's doctor came and asked why we were here today and my husband tell him ""He keeps hitting his head, I know is isn't an ear infection or teething. It's been going on way to long. My son hitting his head as gotten progressively worst in the past few months. It started a tapping and playing with his ear randomly, to only when he's upset but still fairly gentle, to upset and looking painful.

His doctor starting examining him ""ears look good"", ""good eye contract"" and ""oh you communicate so well. My son was sitting there babbling away. He sit down and says ""I know y'all aren't going to say it but he's not autistic. He makes eye contact and autistic kids don't do that. This is probably just a thing he does"". He starts going over milestones. All the physical ones my husband and I quickly say yeah he does that but when he asked about peek a boo. I tell him no and my husband say yeah he's never been into that. He knows you're still there. Then his doctor asked if our son knew the difference between his parents and strangers and before we get to answer he say I don't think he's every met a stranger. We start telling him about how our son will try to leave Walmart with anyone and everyone. He sees people waking and just starts following them. I never ask about my other concerns and we walk out with ""he just does that"".

**After the appointment**
As soon as we get in the car my husband asks if autistic kids beat on their heads. I told him sometime and asks if he wants a second opinion. He nods and says I just don't know any other doctors around here we would bring him to. Of course, I get home and look up early intervention. it seems like all the places a could find on our state's site where surrounding the capital (4 hours away) the closest one was 2 hours away but said on the site their resources are limited and the can not promise to be able to evaluate every kid that applies. Without his doctor on my side it sounds like this may be a tough road.

I came out that doctor's appointment a little relieved but also more confused. All my son's other behaviors I can accept has ""just sometime he does"" but the fact that he seems in distress while hitting his head is too stressful to ignore. I feel like there's a million other reason besides ear infection, autism and just sometime he does and the fact that he doctor didn't put much effort to figure it out bothers me. He's doctor never helps with my concerns. My son doesn't sleep well, get over it, My son doesn't eat well,get over it. Oh and the fact my son hasn't gain weight in 3 months wasn't addressed from his doctor's standpoint it's probably fine but as a mother dealing with a kid who hates food there's a lot of fear involved.

443,t3_7yz4q5,littlewing52,"Agreed.  This is a bone of contention with me.  I work in early intervention primarily with kiddos on or at risk for being on the spectrum.  The kicker is -how- the eye contact is used.  We were talking about this in my office earlier today as a matter of fact. The little guy that we evaluated today would come up and look you in the eyes, but he would not use it in a communicative manner. For instance even if there is a speech delay you would want to see that child at least come up to you and look you in the face with some sort of intent when they want something. Even better if they are to look back and forth between your face and an object that they want while gesturing and vocalizing. If you aren't seeing this, then that is concerning. If you see this, and have other questions feel free to PM me.  I'm Not tooting my own horn, but I've done this for over 10 years now primarily working with kiddos on the autism spectrum. I've gotten very good at teasing out behaviors that are concerning versus behaviors that aren't.",33,"first of all. I didn't think my post would get nearly that much attention.

447,t3_7yz4q5,caffeine_lights,"Yes. What? You can't rule out a diagnosis based on one factor. Your son is very little. Sometimes with autism they do things young and stop doing them later (that's where the whole MMR/regression theory comes from - it's not related to the jabs, it's just a common pattern which happens to coincide timing wise.)

This is like my son's teacher who said ""He can't possibly have ADHD because if he had ADHD he wouldn't be able to stay in his chair."" What? No. I have ADHD and I could definitely stay in a chair. I do not sit *normally* in chairs, I fidget, I swing, I put my legs on the seat - and my son is exactly the same. He falls off chairs quite regularly! When I spoke to his paediatrician thankfully he agreed that we need to see a specialist to get him assessed either way for sure, rather than trying to make a diagnosis he wasn't qualified to make.",2,"first of all.

Right now I’m focusing on finding a cause for his head banging whatever it may be and get pointed into the right direction for finding Early intervention programs near us.  "

**LO's doctor's appointment**
I came home to a completely fed up husband. He tells me that our son has violently hitting his head all morning and that he wasn't going to accept teething for a reason. I asked him if he's going to help me push for an answer and he agrees. My son is literally banging on his head crying up until the moment leave. He takes a nap and the car and wakes as the happiest child ever. He's doctor came and asked why we were here today and my husband tell him ""He keeps hitting his head, I know is isn't an ear infection or teething. It's been going on way to long. My son hitting his head as gotten progressively worst in the past few months. It started a tapping and playing with his ear randomly, to only when he's upset but still fairly gentle, to upset and looking painful.

His doctor starting examining him ""ears look good"", ""good eye contract"" and ""oh you communicate so well. My son was sitting there babbling away. He sit down and says ""I know y'all aren't going to say it but he's not autistic. He makes eye contact and autistic kids don't do that. This is probably just a thing he does"". He starts going over milestones. All the physical ones my husband and I quickly say yeah he does that but when he asked about peek a boo. I tell him no and my husband say yeah he's never been into that. He knows you're still there. Then his doctor asked if our son knew the difference between his parents and strangers and before we get to answer he say I don't think he's every met a stranger. We start telling him about how our son will try to leave Walmart with anyone and everyone. He sees people waking and just starts following them. I never ask about my other concerns and we walk out with ""he just does that"".

**After the appointment**
As soon as we get in the car my husband asks if autistic kids beat on their heads. I told him sometime and asks if he wants a second opinion. He nods and says I just don't know any other doctors around here we would bring him to. Of course, I get home and look up early intervention. it seems like all the places a could find on our state's site where surrounding the capital (4 hours away) the closest one was 2 hours away but said on the site their resources are limited and the can not promise to be able to evaluate every kid that applies. Without his doctor on my side it sounds like this may be a tough road.

I came out that doctor's appointment a little relieved but also more confused. All my son's other behaviors I can accept has ""just sometime he does"" but the fact that he seems in distress while hitting his head is too stressful to ignore. I feel like there's a million other reason besides ear infection, autism and just sometime he does and the fact that he doctor didn't put much effort to figure it out bothers me. He's doctor never helps with my concerns. My son doesn't sleep well, get over it, My son doesn't eat well,get over it. Oh and the fact my son hasn't gain weight in 3 months wasn't addressed from his doctor's standpoint it's probably fine but as a mother dealing with a kid who hates food there's a lot of fear involved.

452,t3_7yz4q5,cornflakegrl,Yeah my husband was a similar story when he was a toddler.

458,t3_7yz4q5,liberaljedi,"Eye contact led to an almost 6 month delay in getting my son diagnosed ASD. When he was little, he would sit on the lap of familiar adults and grab our face and look really intensely in our eyes.

That diagnosis was such a blessing. Between the added services and just an understanding about how we needed to approach working with him has allowed him to really Excel. He's gone from a severely autistic class, to a mild/moderate spec Ed and is now mainstreamed.

He's always been gifted at math and spelling, but now he's also getting good marks on reading comprehension",15,"first of all. I didn't think my post would get nearly that much attention.

465,t3_7yz4q5,evehawksleytrio,"Pediatricians do not have the expertise to diagnose autism. This guy is speaking way out of turn. Our pediatrician said he didn't think autism was likely because of good eye contact and our son being pretty social- BUT he said if we felt the need to investigate what was bothering us he would totally support it and provided us several references. 2 months later we had an autism diagnosis from a two day evaluation from a children's psychologist and it's opened a lot of doors to getting him the therapy needs.

Maybe your son isn't on the spectrum. But your ped is not a psychologist and frankly he's risking your son's well being my dismissing your concerns and not providing you options for a QUALIFIED evaluation. Early treatment is paramount. You need to know if he needs that treatment or not as soon as possible.

Early intervention where we live came and said that he was delayed but didn't provide a formal diagnosis. We contacted a private neurology clinic that was in network for our insurance to get our son evaluated. I highly recommend you just start calling child psychology/neurology practices to try to make an appointment if possible.",12,"first of all.

I came home to a completely fed up husband. He tells me that our son has violently hitting his head all morning and that he wasn't going to accept teething for a reason. I asked him if he's going to help me push for an answer and he agrees. My son is literally banging on his head crying up until the moment leave. He takes a nap and the car and wakes as the happiest child ever. He's doctor came and asked why we were here today and my husband tell him ""He keeps hitting his head, I know is isn't an ear infection or teething. It's been going on way to long. My son hitting his head as gotten progressively worst in the past few months. It started a tapping and playing with his ear randomly, to only when he's upset but still fairly gentle, to upset and looking painful.

His doctor starting examining him ""ears look good"", ""good eye contract"" and ""oh you communicate so well. My son was sitting there babbling away. He sit down and says ""I know y'all aren't going to say it but he's not autistic. He makes eye contact and autistic kids don't do that. This is probably just a thing he does"". He starts going over milestones. All the physical ones my husband and I quickly say yeah he does that but when he asked about peek a boo. I tell him no and my husband say yeah he's never been into that. He knows you're still there. Then his doctor asked if our son knew the difference between his parents and strangers and before we get to answer he say I don't think he's every met a stranger. We start telling him about how our son will try to leave Walmart with anyone and everyone. He sees people waking and just starts following them.

466,t3_7yz4q5,robotdevilhands,"You need to bring him to an expert. The signs of autism can be subtle, and you need someone who can differentiate between autism, sensory processing disorder, and a host of other potential diagnoses.

Look around for the following specialists in your area: developmental pediatrician, developmental psychologist, pediatric neurologist or neuropsych.

They may have waiting lists. Get yourself on a few and then call back weekly to see if there are any cancellations. Early intervention is essential, and the faster you can get a diagnosis, the faster your son can get the help he needs.

Good luck and feel free to PM me if you have any questions. I have a son who was recently diagnosed with ASD.",2,"first of all. I didn't think my post would get nearly that much attention.

468,t3_7yz4q5,littlewing52,"This in it's self is concerning as well.  Autism at it's core is a social communication disorder, so it's not just a speech thing.  Children with ASD have a hard time communicating in any sense (pointing, gestures, signs, a ""knowing look"", etc.)  A good resource I uses is on autismnavigator.com under the ""resources"" tab called the ""video glossary"".  You have to register for it, but it's free, but its literally videos of children both typically developing, and with concerns regarding ASD, in different situations and how they respond.  This may help shed some light on the concerns you have with your son.  Also, (if you are you in the States) every state has a federally mandated Early Intervention program that provides services for free to families who have a child that is eligible.   To be eligible the child has to be found to have a great enough delay that warrants the intervention.  Like I said, it is federally mandated, but each State has their own way of implementing it.  For instance, in my State, the dept. of Ed. is the lead agency, but the Health Dept. carries out all the services.  We don't require a Dr.s referral and I'm fairly certain that is the way it is nation wide.  ",15,"first of all. I didn't think my post would get nearly that much attention.

I asked him if he's going to help me push for an answer and he agrees. My son is literally banging on his head crying up until the moment leave. He takes a nap and the car and wakes as the happiest child ever. He's doctor came and asked why we were here today and my husband tell him ""He keeps hitting his head, I know is isn't an ear infection or teething. It's been going on way to long. My son hitting his head as gotten progressively worst in the past few months. It started a tapping and playing with his ear randomly, to only when he's upset but still fairly gentle, to upset and looking painful.

His doctor starting examining him ""ears look good"", ""good eye contract"" and ""oh you communicate so well. My son was sitting there babbling away. He sit down and says ""I know y'all aren't going to say it but he's not autistic. He makes eye contact and autistic kids don't do that. This is probably just a thing he does"". He starts going over milestones. All the physical ones my husband and I quickly say yeah he does that but when he asked about peek a boo. I tell him no and my husband say yeah he's never been into that. He knows you're still there. Then his doctor asked if our son knew the difference between his parents and strangers and before we get to answer he say I don't think he's every met a stranger. We start telling him about how our son will try to leave Walmart with anyone and everyone. He sees people waking and just starts following them. I never ask about my other concerns and we walk out with ""he just does that"".

**After the appointment**
As soon as we get in the car my husband asks if autistic kids beat on their heads. I told him sometime and asks if he wants a second opinion. He nods and says I just don't know any other doctors around here we would bring him to. Of course, I get home and look up early intervention. it seems like all the places a could find on our state's site where surrounding the capital (4 hours away) the closest one was 2 hours away but said on the site their resources are limited and the can not promise to be able to evaluate every kid that applies. Without his doctor on my side it sounds like this may be a tough road.

I came out that doctor's appointment a little relieved but also more confused. All my son's other behaviors I can accept has ""just sometime he does"" but the fact that he seems in distress while hitting his head is too stressful to ignore. I feel like there's a million other reason besides ear infection, autism and just sometime he does and the fact that he doctor didn't put much effort to figure it out bothers me. He's doctor never helps with my concerns. My son doesn't sleep well, get over it, My son doesn't eat well,get over it. Oh and the fact my son hasn't gain weight in 3 months wasn't addressed from his doctor's standpoint it's probably fine but as a mother dealing with a kid who hates food there's a lot of fear involved.

I have an acquaintance who’s son has sensory processing disorder as well as other development problems so I got the name and number of the doctor she uses.  Plan to make an appointment tomorrow. Right now I’m focusing on finding a cause for his head banging whatever it may be and get pointed into the right direction for finding Early intervention programs near us.  "
473,t3_7yz4q5,Greenbeanhead,"People with autism seek public acceptance for how they are, while people like you think something is “wrong”with them. 

Typical people, neurologically speaking, exhibit bad behaviors all the time. But by your standards nothing is “wrong” with them. 

Again. The behavior is not typical, an inconsiderate person might say wrong. But a small child with autism doesn’t have something wrong with them. They are different, not wrong.

474,t3_7yz4q5,sexylibrarian727,"Lots of people have things wrong with them though. It’s an indication that your body isn’t working the way it was intended to. I had terrible eyesight, family members have type 1 diabetes, etc. When I say “wrong” I am clearly speaking to the physiological issues here. Something is not functioning correctly within their brain, therefore something is medically wrong. A neurotypical person who behaves badly is making a choice to behave that way, they are not doing it because they have a disorder. You may not like the terms, but saying something is “wrong” is not the same as saying a child is bad or unworthy of love or respect. It literal just means that they are not functioning in a typical way due to a disorder. I don’t know how else to articulate this, but if you’re insulted by it I guess we just disagree. There is a reason these things are called “disorders”, combatted with “therapies”. Because something is going wrong and we are trying to fix it or manage it better so the child gets the most out of life.",1,"first of all. I didn't think my post would get nearly that much attention.

475,t3_7yz4q5,Greenbeanhead,"Wrong implies it can be made right. Wrong implies there is a right way to develop and grow. Autism isn’t that way, there is no “cure”. 

The therapies are to correct behaviors, not to make the brain change (like your shitty eyesight analogy). They exhibit behaviors that are not typical, and you could call those wrong if it makes you feel better. 

People are born with these types of brains, and nothing will ever change that. There is nothing wrong with them, they are just different. 

April is autism awareness month. Try going around telling everyone there’s just something wrong with those people and they need to get it right. Good luck. ",1,"first of all.

476,t3_8s9ma8,,[deleted],10,"Kiddo is 3.5. We had our share of head bonks when he was learning to walk, but nothing major. The worst was a fall from 1 step onto a tile floor, backwards. That sound of a melon being dropped on the floor will haunt me...

At school yesterday, he was running, tripped, and smacked his forehead off of their floor - laminate. Big goose egg on his forehead, ice, cuddles, all good.

483,t3_8ksgdn,witch_life,"My kid started doing the same kind of things around that age. I think it’s mostly frustration that they can’t explain what they want coupled with them being much more mobile and their little brains maturing. Just like a lot of shit going on at once.

In my experience, it got better after a few months once my kid was able to communicate more and do more things independently. Though now at 1.5 she has started doing that “I didn’t get my way, better throw myself on the floor” horseshit occasionally.

You can try teaching your kid a few signs for common things to help her articulate her needs a bit better until she can say it herself.",5,"My daughter turns one in a little less then two weeks, and for about two weeks now (honestly probably a bit longer) she started throwing temper tantrums. It definitely caught me off guard. I’m a ftm and thought this was something that happened much older. But needless to say here we are.
I’m hoping for advice or insight on dealing with a baby haveing tantrums. I know because she can’t articulate herself or understand as well as a two year old, what works usually for older kids won’t work for her.
Here’s some basic info
The tantrums are usually her throwing herself on the ground, banging her head against stuff and flailing.

I was a sahm all her life so she’s pretty clingy. The tantrums usually always happen when I either tell her not to do something (knock down a lamp, throw laundry ect) or when I leave the room to do something.
Usually it’s not to bad unless she’s tired and I’m working on changing her routine and naps around to accommodate this. Because she was fine with a nap around 1130 then another in st 330 now it seams she’s exhausted an hour before both.

Diaper changes are THE worst. She wriggles and flails and screams. I’m positive it’s because she has all this new found movement (walking) that she doesn’t want to be held or slowed down. I feel bad but I’ve definitely waiting a little longer to change a pee diaper just because it’s such a battle. I try to make it fun and kiss her tummy and play with her feet but that only works in the beginning. I started giving her a thermometer cover (too big to choke one) when I’m changing her and taking it away when I’m done so it’s still special. This helps a bit and she’s ok while I change her, but when I take it away it’s the same thing.

I feel so bad because I just want to help her and I can’t and I’m getting afraid she’s really going to hurt herself.

485,t3_8ksgdn,MvmtOm,"My baby is 11 months old and has recently started having meltdowns during diaper changes. About a week or so ago, we started doing his diaper changes standing up. Definitely is a learning curve! But it's significantly easier than listening to him WAIL at the top of his lungs! Some things that make the stand up diaper changes easier for us:
- he's still mostly wearing onesies, so we snap the onesie over his shoulder to get the flaps out of the way
-when putting the diaper on, I'm directly behind him, squatting, and I press the front of my leg ( just below my knee), to the back of his diaper while I'm assembling.  This helps keep the diaper in place while I'm attaching the two diaper sides.
-he now has his own (empty) wipes container on the shelf at his level. He likes to open and close it.., and is currently keeping him entertained.

Usually it’s not to bad unless she’s tired and I’m working on changing her routine and naps around to accommodate this. Because she was fine with a nap around 1130 then another in st 330 now it seams she’s exhausted an hour before both.

Diaper changes are THE worst. She wriggles and flails and screams. I’m positive it’s because she has all this new found movement (walking) that she doesn’t want to be held or slowed down. I feel bad but I’ve definitely waiting a little longer to change a pee diaper just because it’s such a battle. I try to make it fun and kiss her tummy and play with her feet but that only works in the beginning. I started giving her a thermometer cover (too big to choke one) when I’m changing her and taking it away when I’m done so it’s still special. This helps a bit and she’s ok while I change her, but when I take it away it’s the same thing.

I feel so bad because I just want to help her and I can’t and I’m getting afraid she’s really going to hurt herself.

Sorry if this is ramble and badly formatted I’m in mobile.
I would appreciated my thought or tips on dealing with a baby having tantrums. Thanks!"

488,t3_63lgha,silliesandsmiles,"Empathy is incredibly hard to teach. I nanny a 7f who struggles with it consistently. She gets very frustrated when she doesn't feel like she is getting enough attention. She also has ADHD and sees a behavioral therapist on a regular basis. One of the things that helped us was giving her a short time of undivided attention at the beginning of the day. She gets 10 minutes before she leaves for school to chat with me about whatever she would like, or play whatever she likes exactly how she wants it. But beyond that, she is expected to be ok with not getting 100% of my attention every moment of the day. After her 10 minutes, her sister also gets 10 minutes. If she is rude during her sisters time, I just keep starting the timer over until she has had a solid 10 minutes of her own. 

How do you play with her? I do my best to also emulate a traditional friendship when we play. Obviously as an adult I don't care what the doll's name is or what she is wearing, but I also don't like 7F dictate that either, just as another friend wouldn't. She also doesn't get to be the only one to decide what we play. We talk about what she wants to play, what I do, and then we decide. I often say, ""sorry, I'm not in the mood to play x right now. Could we play y or z instead?"" At the start of a game, she can make two ""pretends"", things she really wants to have happen during the game. Beyond that, I do not let her say things like, ""pretend your doll asks if we can go shopping!"" Because that wouldn't fly with other friends. She doesn't get to dictate what I say or do. She can make suggestions, which I may or may not take. This helped immensely for her, because she was treating her friends like subordinates in games, and as they got older, they figured it out and stopped wanting to play with her.",192,"My daughter has been with the same group of kids since Pre-K. She's smart and funny and not at all shy or timid like I was. When she was younger, friendship was easy. Whoever was around was who you played with, and whoever you played with was a friend.

At almost 7 now, things are no longer quite so simple in her world, and I'm sad for her. We used to have birthday parties to go to every weekend. Now that kids and parents are more selective about their guest list, the invites are drying up. She's come home from after-care after school several times this year crying inconsolably because someone was mean to her, everyone ignored her, or my personal favorite ""Nobody likes me."" which leaves me pulling my hair out and banging my head into the wall trying to puzzle out what that means, and what specifically happened to make her think that.

I know it's not true that nobody likes her, but I'm afraid that it might come to that eventually. She's in several activities with classmates outside of school, and I've taken the opportunity to watch how she interacts in those settings. We get to the gym for play rehearsal. A classmate will spot her and happily wave and yell her name. She gives the barest of acknowledgement. During girl scouts, every other girl will be huddled in one group, talking or playing a game, yet she is off doing her own thing, dancing in the middle of the room and singing to herself.

What I feel is that she is slightly behind her peers on empathy and group cooperation. Oftentimes her ""nobody wanted to play with me"" actually means ""I wanted to play this game, but everyone else was playing something else, so I played alone and felt sorry for myself about it."" She understands her own feelings and how others can hurt them, but she doesn't seem to grasp that her behavior can hurt other people's feelings and push them away. Recently she told me about a friend at after-care saying mean things to her and wouldn't apologize, and how she spent the entire time after that crying and throwing a fit. She described how multiple other friends repeatedly tried to talk to her, calm her down, and encourage the other girl to apologize, but she just couldn't stop crying. What immediately stuck out to me about this was that she was so focused (both in the moment and while retelling it) about her own feelings and how she'd been wronged by one person, that she didn't consider how she was affecting anyone else. It makes me sad and frustrated because she can't see that she does have friends that care about her, and by the time she realizes it I feel like she'll have pushed them away.

I've tried to be kind but blunt with her. I've told her that she has to first *be* a good friend before she can expect others to be a good friend to her. I've told her that when someone is always crying and upset, other people don't want to hang around them because it brings them down. I acknowledge her feelings when a friend is mean or dismissive to her, and I encourage her to tell them that it hurt her feelings, and to think about what she may have done to hurt *their* feelings and apologize. When we see her friends at after-school activities, *I* make sure to greet them enthusiastically and by name so that she can see me do it. When she cries about an unsuccessful social interaction, I try to instill that it's not the end of the world and she can always try again tomorrow.  I'm at my wits end with how to guide her. I can't make friends *for* her, or I would probably try. 

I guess the reason I feel so strongly about all of this is because I see so much of myself in her. These lessons about friendship, empathy and cooperation didn't fully sink in for me until college. I want to try to help her learn quicker than I did so that she can have an easier path. Is there anything I can do to help her develop more empathy and pro-social attitudes?"

490,t3_63lgha,sarcazm,"My son doesn't display everything you've described, but some of it is similar. Kids would yell all the time ""Hi, John!"" and he wouldn't say anything back. This started when he was fairly young (4-5 years old). I would always whisper to him, ""Say 'hi'."" Because I knew how it looked. I knew he was just shy or unsure about how to react, but it looked like he was being rude. So, I sat him down and was very specific. ""When kids say hi to you, you say hi back. It's friendly and you can make more friends that way and keep the friends you already have. When they say hi to you, it means they like you.""

I don't try to be vague: ""Treat others how you want to be treated."" That can mean a million different things to a 5-7 year old. 

I tell him to play with his friends when he's with his friends (birthdays, at the park, at school, soccer, etc.). It shows that he appreciates them being there with him.

He's 8 years old now and is doing much better. He says ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" to anyone who says it to him. He loves going to school and never complains about ""not having friends.""

I recommend this book:

[How to Make & Keep Friends: Tips for Kids to Overcome 50 Common Social Challenges](https://www.amazon.com/How-Make-Keep-Friends-Challenges/dp/1456313460/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491424635&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+make+friends+for+kids)

It's very specific and simple enough for young kids. It lists out actions kids can take to make friends.

Examples:

- Remind yourself before your arrive somewhere that you will properly greet the people you see.

- When you enter a place or a room, enter quietly without flinging or banging doors or running in a wild manner.

- Move in and away from the door so that other people can enter if needed.

- Stop and look directly at the person or people you are greeting.

- If looking at the person is difficult for you, make sure your shoulders are turned fully toward the person.

- Say hello to the person or people.

- If someone say, ""Hello, how are you today?"" you should answer ""I'm fine, thanks, and how are you?""

- Observe any other people that might already be in the room and notice what they are doing and how they are acting - try to do the same.

- Ask permission before touching or using anything.

- If a parent or another adult is dropping you off, make sure that you look at them and say ""Goodbye"" or ""See you in a while.""

These actions are secondary nature to you and me and other adults, but not to a lot of young children. And no, you don't have to be autistic to miss these cues.

492,t3_63lgha,Beersyummy,"This is tough, I agree. I can see some similarities in your description of your daughter with my son, who is 4. He's a very outgoing kid, but he can be very emotional, and he also has very strict ideas about how HE wants to play, and gets upset if kids don't want to play HIS WAY. I try to remind him to take turns with ""choosing the game"" or ""being the leader"". That sometimes it's his turn to choose the game, and sometimes it's our friends turn to choose the game. I have also noticed that he seems to do better with some kids one on one vs. with a group. So, I try to foster those friendships with the kids he does play well with. I also focus on the fact that everyone makes mistakes. So, if a friend says something mean to him, or excludes him, they're making a mistake. If they say sorry, accept their apology and try to move on. 

It sounds like you're on the right track with keeping an eye on it and trying to talk through the behavior with her. Just keep on it. I would also talk to her teachers/other caregivers as they have a lot of experience with peer social interactions. They might have some additional strategies to try.

I've told her that when someone is always crying and upset, other people don't want to hang around them because it brings them down.

495,t3_63lgha,TheHatOnTheCat,"It's great that you see your daughter needs help with her social skills and are working to teach and support her.

Have you considered having her evaluated? If you live in the US can ask the school district to do this for you though it can take time so the sooner the better. Girls are often under-diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder or diagnosed later. 

I absolutely can not draw conclusions from what you have written but some of it sounds like it could maybe be ASD. Difficulty with emotional regulation, difficulty perspective taking, doing her own physically stimulating activity while every other girl in scouts is huddled talking, perhaps less of an innate picking of social rules, rigidity, these things *could maybe* indicate ASD. If you get her assessed and she does get a diagnosis you could ask for social skills training for your child which exists in a variety of forms. If she doesn't, great!, and you could still ask the psychologist for advice on how to approach this. Talking to classroom teachers is also often helpful.

501,t3_63lgha,Ninja_Platypus,"Is she on the autism spectrum? Honestly she sounds much like my kids with autism and their autistic peers. Social skill and empathy aren't always easy for them. Practice and age help tons. If she hasn't been evaluated, i encourage you to do so. If not autism they can still point you in right direction for her. ",5,"My daughter has been with the same group of kids since Pre-K. She's smart and funny and not at all shy or timid like I was. When she was younger, friendship was easy. Whoever was around was who you played with, and whoever you played with was a friend.

At almost 7 now, things are no longer quite so simple in her world, and I'm sad for her. We used to have birthday parties to go to every weekend. Now that kids and parents are more selective about their guest list, the invites are drying up. She's come home from after-care after school several times this year crying inconsolably because someone was mean to her, everyone ignored her, or my personal favorite ""Nobody likes me."" which leaves me pulling my hair out and banging my head into the wall trying to puzzle out what that means, and what specifically happened to make her think that.

I know it's not true that nobody likes her, but I'm afraid that it might come to that eventually. She's in several activities with classmates outside of school, and I've taken the opportunity to watch how she interacts in those settings. We get to the gym for play rehearsal. A classmate will spot her and happily wave and yell her name. She gives the barest of acknowledgement. During girl scouts, every other girl will be huddled in one group, talking or playing a game, yet she is off doing her own thing, dancing in the middle of the room and singing to herself.

What I feel is that she is slightly behind her peers on empathy and group cooperation. Oftentimes her ""nobody wanted to play with me"" actually means ""I wanted to play this game, but everyone else was playing something else, so I played alone and felt sorry for myself about it."" She understands her own feelings and how others can hurt them, but she doesn't seem to grasp that her behavior can hurt other people's feelings and push them away. Recently she told me about a friend at after-care saying mean things to her and wouldn't apologize, and how she spent the entire time after that crying and throwing a fit. She described how multiple other friends repeatedly tried to talk to her, calm her down, and encourage the other girl to apologize, but she just couldn't stop crying. What immediately stuck out to me about this was that she was so focused (both in the moment and while retelling it) about her own feelings and how she'd been wronged by one person, that she didn't consider how she was affecting anyone else. It makes me sad and frustrated because she can't see that she does have friends that care about her, and by the time she realizes it I feel like she'll have pushed them away.

I've tried to be kind but blunt with her. I've told her that she has to first *be* a good friend before she can expect others to be a good friend to her. I've told her that when someone is always crying and upset, other people don't want to hang around them because it brings them down. I acknowledge her feelings when a friend is mean or dismissive to her, and I encourage her to tell them that it hurt her feelings, and to think about what she may have done to hurt *their* feelings and apologize. When we see her friends at after-school activities, *I* make sure to greet them enthusiastically and by name so that she can see me do it. When she cries about an unsuccessful social interaction, I try to instill that it's not the end of the world and she can always try again tomorrow.  I'm at my wits end with how to guide her. I can't make friends *for* her, or I would probably try.

502,t3_63lgha,DearestToMyHeart,"I immediately thought of my little brother! He is like this too, but now at almost 9 he's improving a lot. 

His taste never matched ANY of his friends at school so he'd be upset no one wanted to play what he wanted and go with the ""nobody likes me"" just like your daughter. he never wanted to try his friends games. 

We kept telling him to be understanding that not everyone likes his stuff and maybe if he gives it a try he might enjoy other things too. At home he plays with some boys from the same building, my mother used to watch closely and kinda of dictate what they'd play like ""first you do what (friend) wants then you two do what (little brother) wants). It worked both ways, he now tries to understand more and so does his friends.

503,t3_63lgha,funchy,"Could it be she's gotten into the habit of negative thought patterns, and when she walks into the room the waving classmate is interpreted as ""not special. She waves to everyone"".  Or ""she didnt smile when she waved and i know she only means it when she smiles.""
By the end of the session of course shes by herself.  And it becomes self reinforcing. She walked into the room believing shed be alone, and ""see  it's true.""

You'll have to coach to her to choose positive views instead of negatives.   This is a technique taught in therapy.

505,t3_63lgha,rosyelephant,"Do you arrange play dates with these friends? It sounds like you have her in a lot of after school activities which is nice but children learn how to navigate social situations through unstructured play. Plus at her age, a lot of these kids will be hanging out with each other outside of school and structured activities. This leads to them having much tighter knit relationships with each other versus the kids they just see at school and activities.

A good therapist knows how to make sure the kids don't feel singled out and broken. It can even become her favorite part of the day. The therapist will also coach you on what to do at home to help.

You can try the techniques others mentioned, but it's been going on long enough that if you can afford it- it'll have quicker results to get professional guidance.

I've told her that when someone is always crying and upset, other people don't want to hang around them because it brings them down. I acknowledge her feelings when a friend is mean or dismissive to her, and I encourage her to tell them that it hurt her feelings, and to think about what she may have done to hurt *their* feelings and apologize. When we see her friends at after-school activities, *I* make sure to greet them enthusiastically and by name so that she can see me do it. When she cries about an unsuccessful social interaction, I try to instill that it's not the end of the world and she can always try again tomorrow.  I'm at my wits end with how to guide her. I can't make friends *for* her, or I would probably try. 

I guess the reason I feel so strongly about all of this is because I see so much of myself in her. These lessons about friendship, empathy and cooperation didn't fully sink in for me until college. I want to try to help her learn quicker than I did so that she can have an easier path. Is there anything I can do to help her develop more empathy and pro-social attitudes?"
517,t3_63lgha,boardgame_enthusiast,I really appreciate you typing this out i can see it becoming an issue with my eldest so I'm going to start implementing some of this stuff.,13,"My daughter has been with the same group of kids since Pre-K. She's smart and funny and not at all shy or timid like I was. When she was younger, friendship was easy. Whoever was around was who you played with, and whoever you played with was a friend.

At almost 7 now, things are no longer quite so simple in her world, and I'm sad for her. We used to have birthday parties to go to every weekend. Now that kids and parents are more selective about their guest list, the invites are drying up. She's come home from after-care after school several times this year crying inconsolably because someone was mean to her, everyone ignored her, or my personal favorite ""Nobody likes me."" which leaves me pulling my hair out and banging my head into the wall trying to puzzle out what that means, and what specifically happened to make her think that.

I know it's not true that nobody likes her, but I'm afraid that it might come to that eventually. She's in several activities with classmates outside of school, and I've taken the opportunity to watch how she interacts in those settings. We get to the gym for play rehearsal.

During girl scouts, every other girl will be huddled in one group, talking or playing a game, yet she is off doing her own thing, dancing in the middle of the room and singing to herself.

520,t3_63lgha,chula198705,"This is actually really comforting advice for me, re: playing like an actual friend. Often when I'm playing with my daughter (3), she'll suggest a game that I really don't feel like playing AGAIN or something that I don't feel like cleaning up after, and I'll tell her I don't want to play that and suggest something else. There have been a couple times we couldn't agree on what to play, so I just went and did something on my own while she did her own thing.

525,t3_63lgha,homelessmermaid,that's my niece. I can see her pouting right before my eyes. ,5,"My daughter has been with the same group of kids since Pre-K. She's smart and funny and not at all shy or timid like I was. When she was younger, friendship was easy. Whoever was around was who you played with, and whoever you played with was a friend.

At almost 7 now, things are no longer quite so simple in her world, and I'm sad for her. We used to have birthday parties to go to every weekend. Now that kids and parents are more selective about their guest list, the invites are drying up. She's come home from after-care after school several times this year crying inconsolably because someone was mean to her, everyone ignored her, or my personal favorite ""Nobody likes me."" which leaves me pulling my hair out and banging my head into the wall trying to puzzle out what that means, and what specifically happened to make her think that.

I know it's not true that nobody likes her, but I'm afraid that it might come to that eventually. She's in several activities with classmates outside of school, and I've taken the opportunity to watch how she interacts in those settings. We get to the gym for play rehearsal. A classmate will spot her and happily wave and yell her name. She gives the barest of acknowledgement. During girl scouts, every other girl will be huddled in one group, talking or playing a game, yet she is off doing her own thing, dancing in the middle of the room and singing to herself.

What I feel is that she is slightly behind her peers on empathy and group cooperation. Oftentimes her ""nobody wanted to play with me"" actually means ""I wanted to play this game, but everyone else was playing something else, so I played alone and felt sorry for myself about it."" She understands her own feelings and how others can hurt them, but she doesn't seem to grasp that her behavior can hurt other people's feelings and push them away. Recently she told me about a friend at after-care saying mean things to her and wouldn't apologize, and how she spent the entire time after that crying and throwing a fit. She described how multiple other friends repeatedly tried to talk to her, calm her down, and encourage the other girl to apologize, but she just couldn't stop crying. What immediately stuck out to me about this was that she was so focused (both in the moment and while retelling it) about her own feelings and how she'd been wronged by one person, that she didn't consider how she was affecting anyone else. It makes me sad and frustrated because she can't see that she does have friends that care about her, and by the time she realizes it I feel like she'll have pushed them away.

I've tried to be kind but blunt with her. I've told her that she has to first *be* a good friend before she can expect others to be a good friend to her. I've told her that when someone is always crying and upset, other people don't want to hang around them because it brings them down. I acknowledge her feelings when a friend is mean or dismissive to her, and I encourage her to tell them that it hurt her feelings, and to think about what she may have done to hurt *their* feelings and apologize. When we see her friends at after-school activities, *I* make sure to greet them enthusiastically and by name so that she can see me do it. When she cries about an unsuccessful social interaction, I try to instill that it's not the end of the world and she can always try again tomorrow.  I'm at my wits end with how to guide her. I can't make friends *for* her, or I would probably try.

Now that kids and parents are more selective about their guest list, the invites are drying up. She's come home from after-care after school several times this year crying inconsolably because someone was mean to her, everyone ignored her, or my personal favorite ""Nobody likes me."" which leaves me pulling my hair out and banging my head into the wall trying to puzzle out what that means, and what specifically happened to make her think that.

I know it's not true that nobody likes her, but I'm afraid that it might come to that eventually. She's in several activities with classmates outside of school, and I've taken the opportunity to watch how she interacts in those settings. We get to the gym for play rehearsal. A classmate will spot her and happily wave and yell her name. She gives the barest of acknowledgement. During girl scouts, every other girl will be huddled in one group, talking or playing a game, yet she is off doing her own thing, dancing in the middle of the room and singing to herself.

What I feel is that she is slightly behind her peers on empathy and group cooperation. Oftentimes her ""nobody wanted to play with me"" actually means ""I wanted to play this game, but everyone else was playing something else, so I played alone and felt sorry for myself about it."" She understands her own feelings and how others can hurt them, but she doesn't seem to grasp that her behavior can hurt other people's feelings and push them away. Recently she told me about a friend at after-care saying mean things to her and wouldn't apologize, and how she spent the entire time after that crying and throwing a fit. She described how multiple other friends repeatedly tried to talk to her, calm her down, and encourage the other girl to apologize, but she just couldn't stop crying. What immediately stuck out to me about this was that she was so focused (both in the moment and while retelling it) about her own feelings and how she'd been wronged by one person, that she didn't consider how she was affecting anyone else. It makes me sad and frustrated because she can't see that she does have friends that care about her, and by the time she realizes it I feel like she'll have pushed them away.

I've tried to be kind but blunt with her. I've told her that she has to first *be* a good friend before she can expect others to be a good friend to her. I've told her that when someone is always crying and upset, other people don't want to hang around them because it brings them down. I acknowledge her feelings when a friend is mean or dismissive to her, and I encourage her to tell them that it hurt her feelings, and to think about what she may have done to hurt *their* feelings and apologize. When we see her friends at after-school activities, *I* make sure to greet them enthusiastically and by name so that she can see me do it. When she cries about an unsuccessful social interaction, I try to instill that it's not the end of the world and she can always try again tomorrow.  I'm at my wits end with how to guide her. I can't make friends *for* her, or I would probably try. 

I guess the reason I feel so strongly about all of this is because I see so much of myself in her. These lessons about friendship, empathy and cooperation didn't fully sink in for me until college. I want to try to help her learn quicker than I did so that she can have an easier path. Is there anything I can do to help her develop more empathy and pro-social attitudes?"

She's come home from after-care after school several times this year crying inconsolably because someone was mean to her, everyone ignored her, or my personal favorite ""Nobody likes me."" which leaves me pulling my hair out and banging my head into the wall trying to puzzle out what that means, and what specifically happened to make her think that.

I know it's not true that nobody likes her, but I'm afraid that it might come to that eventually. She's in several activities with classmates outside of school, and I've taken the opportunity to watch how she interacts in those settings. We get to the gym for play rehearsal. A classmate will spot her and happily wave and yell her name. She gives the barest of acknowledgement. During girl scouts, every other girl will be huddled in one group, talking or playing a game, yet she is off doing her own thing, dancing in the middle of the room and singing to herself.

What I feel is that she is slightly behind her peers on empathy and group cooperation. Oftentimes her ""nobody wanted to play with me"" actually means ""I wanted to play this game, but everyone else was playing something else, so I played alone and felt sorry for myself about it."" She understands her own feelings and how others can hurt them, but she doesn't seem to grasp that her behavior can hurt other people's feelings and push them away. Recently she told me about a friend at after-care saying mean things to her and wouldn't apologize, and how she spent the entire time after that crying and throwing a fit. She described how multiple other friends repeatedly tried to talk to her, calm her down, and encourage the other girl to apologize, but she just couldn't stop crying. What immediately stuck out to me about this was that she was so focused (both in the moment and while retelling it) about her own feelings and how she'd been wronged by one person, that she didn't consider how she was affecting anyone else. It makes me sad and frustrated because she can't see that she does have friends that care about her, and by the time she realizes it I feel like she'll have pushed them away.

I've tried to be kind but blunt with her. I've told her that she has to first *be* a good friend before she can expect others to be a good friend to her. I've told her that when someone is always crying and upset, other people don't want to hang around them because it brings them down. I acknowledge her feelings when a friend is mean or dismissive to her, and I encourage her to tell them that it hurt her feelings, and to think about what she may have done to hurt *their* feelings and apologize. When we see her friends at after-school activities, *I* make sure to greet them enthusiastically and by name so that she can see me do it. When she cries about an unsuccessful social interaction, I try to instill that it's not the end of the world and she can always try again tomorrow.  I'm at my wits end with how to guide her. I can't make friends *for* her, or I would probably try. 

I guess the reason I feel so strongly about all of this is because I see so much of myself in her. These lessons about friendship, empathy and cooperation didn't fully sink in for me until college. I want to try to help her learn quicker than I did so that she can have an easier path. Is there anything I can do to help her develop more empathy and pro-social attitudes?"

Even when they are, she has to learn to not be dismissive of others. If she has a day where she is particularly struggling, I tell her that I don't play with people who don't treat me equally and fairly, and she's on her own for a bit.

She's smart and funny and not at all shy or timid like I was. When she was younger, friendship was easy. Whoever was around was who you played with, and whoever you played with was a friend.

At almost 7 now, things are no longer quite so simple in her world, and I'm sad for her. We used to have birthday parties to go to every weekend. Now that kids and parents are more selective about their guest list, the invites are drying up. She's come home from after-care after school several times this year crying inconsolably because someone was mean to her, everyone ignored her, or my personal favorite ""Nobody likes me."" which leaves me pulling my hair out and banging my head into the wall trying to puzzle out what that means, and what specifically happened to make her think that.

I know it's not true that nobody likes her, but I'm afraid that it might come to that eventually. She's in several activities with classmates outside of school, and I've taken the opportunity to watch how she interacts in those settings. We get to the gym for play rehearsal. A classmate will spot her and happily wave and yell her name. She gives the barest of acknowledgement. During girl scouts, every other girl will be huddled in one group, talking or playing a game, yet she is off doing her own thing, dancing in the middle of the room and singing to herself.

What I feel is that she is slightly behind her peers on empathy and group cooperation. Oftentimes her ""nobody wanted to play with me"" actually means ""I wanted to play this game, but everyone else was playing something else, so I played alone and felt sorry for myself about it."" She understands her own feelings and how others can hurt them, but she doesn't seem to grasp that her behavior can hurt other people's feelings and push them away. Recently she told me about a friend at after-care saying mean things to her and wouldn't apologize, and how she spent the entire time after that crying and throwing a fit. She described how multiple other friends repeatedly tried to talk to her, calm her down, and encourage the other girl to apologize, but she just couldn't stop crying. What immediately stuck out to me about this was that she was so focused (both in the moment and while retelling it) about her own feelings and how she'd been wronged by one person, that she didn't consider how she was affecting anyone else. It makes me sad and frustrated because she can't see that she does have friends that care about her, and by the time she realizes it I feel like she'll have pushed them away.

I've tried to be kind but blunt with her. I've told her that she has to first *be* a good friend before she can expect others to be a good friend to her. I've told her that when someone is always crying and upset, other people don't want to hang around them because it brings them down. I acknowledge her feelings when a friend is mean or dismissive to her, and I encourage her to tell them that it hurt her feelings, and to think about what she may have done to hurt *their* feelings and apologize. When we see her friends at after-school activities, *I* make sure to greet them enthusiastically and by name so that she can see me do it. When she cries about an unsuccessful social interaction, I try to instill that it's not the end of the world and she can always try again tomorrow.  I'm at my wits end with how to guide her. I can't make friends *for* her, or I would probably try. 

I guess the reason I feel so strongly about all of this is because I see so much of myself in her. These lessons about friendship, empathy and cooperation didn't fully sink in for me until college. I want to try to help her learn quicker than I did so that she can have an easier path. Is there anything I can do to help her develop more empathy and pro-social attitudes?"
550,t3_86ptgu,Roupert2,"Just remember that if you weren't in a city, you'd be driving everywhere. The car seat is often a struggle at this age. But there's just no choice, you have to leave the house, so stroller or carseat is just non-negotiable. 

I'm not saying it's a fun or easy phase, but you just need to power through it. I found distraction to be the best way to get a balking toddler into the carseat. Then eventually they give up fighting.

It's getting harder for me to take her places and get stuff done.  She refuses to get in the stroller. She planks and will not put her butt down.

Sometime she pulls so hard against the straps that they dig in.  I have tried giving her a toy, food, and even my cell phone in desperation and she throws it all to the ground.  I have tried to abandon the stroller and use a carrier and she also will not tolerate that.  She will scream, arch her back and scratch my neck and face and hit me. I tried a back carry and she grabs my hair and pulls! She is also very heavy and I can't carry her like that for long periods of time. When we walk she will refuse to hold my hand and when I try to hold on to her wrists she will fall to the ground and make herself limp and bang her head to the ground in frustration.  The only way she likes to travel is by herself. No hand holding whatsoever. I tried getting one of those toddler leashes and she absolutely was appalled.  She just pulled on it kept on falling over and got really angry, fell to the ground and started banging her head.  She is totally happy and ""normal"" and fairly well-behaved in every other way.

553,t3_86ptgu,Szyz,"Being that age is very hard.  You have so many ideas and things you want to do, and things you hate, but you can't tell anyone any of it. And, even worse, eveyone thinks you're still a bundle that can just have all this stuff done to it without asking or explanation.

I would have a multipronged approach to this. Start talking to her, a lot. Explain eveything, and try as much as you can to narrate what she appears to be thinking or feeling as well. That can be magic - if you are right in what they are thinking/wanting they can quiet right down to listen, and calm down because they see you understand. At this age they understand every word you say, it's just talking that is hard. The book how to listen so kids will talk is a great one for this.

Second, distract, distract, diastract. and not once the planking has started, but well before. Talk right past what is about to happen and off into a glorious, rosy, enthusiastic future. It would go like this: you palm/pocket a snack/toy, then say to kid ""hey, did you know we have no apples left!  i want more apples, [hand kid snack/toy as you lift them up] why don't we go to the shop [put kid in stroller] to get more apples! [start pushing stroller] shall we get yellow or green or red apples today?""

You're also going to have to try using countdown warnings for transitions (your kids temperament will determine how much/often/long).

Are you choosing your time very very carefully?  you can't just go out because you need to. Kid needs to be well rested, not hungry, having a good day, etc.

 in terms of honoring the impulse,mare there gated playgrounds or big fields or children's museums where she can run freely?

At the end of the day, if she flops around because she is wearing a leash, that's not actually a problem. There is no option, she will be in the stroller or on the leash ( i think holding your hand is a distant third here) if she wants to go to the playground.  It just is.

It sounds like you're setting yourself (and everyone else, too) up for a nightmare experience, and I don't understand why.

It's not the caps of markers, tires off of toy cars, water bottles or pictures of buses he lines up. It's a real toy.He uses it appropriately too. I'm so damn happy.


It's one of those Target brand 18 inch dolls. I bought one for my niece for her birthday and my son saw it and instantly wanted it He's autistic, low verbal and doesn't speak unpromped very often so  when he started saying ""Open. This this. Gus want"" it was hard for me not to open it, but i was scared he just liked the color of the box. Also, it wasn't for him and he just doesn't get stuff becasue his meltdowns wear me out and give me bruises. The meltdown was epic and lasted a long time.


The next day I went out and found one at a thrift store for $2 in great shape, but naked. I bought it some footless preemie pajamas just like his and we brought it out during speech. That day he learned the word 'dolly' and uses it appropriately and regularly.


He takes it with him and it sits and watches him line up his buses and he likes to sing the song ""Daddy Finger"" over and over and he uses the dolls hands to do it too. His way he wants anyone to 'play' with him is for them to just watch what he's doing and not move. I love it. This doll is the perfect playmate.



My husband's family is coming to visit to essentially meet Gus for the first time. They have little understanding about autism and are not big planners, so we found out that they're camping 45 minutes from town. My son hates dirt, is scared of leaves and the wind, is a runner and has learned to climb fences and doesn't look back or have 'stranger danger', so this is going to be the most stressful thing for him AND us. He self harms when he's too stressed (bangs his head) and doesn't feel pain, so he'd go full force on concrete if we let him. We've transitioned him to jumping on a trampoline instead of head banging and it's fucking amazing but we can't bring that with us.



My SIL has 2 girls that are 2 and 7. They love American Girl dolls and have about 20 or more. They only have American Girl dolls and they take them everywhere.  They're young and all young kids have issues sharing, but the older one threw a gift we got her across the room becasue it was the wrong color. She doesn't share well and my SIL has a more lax idea on parenting in general. 
Now, I totally see an issue. Even if they only bring 3 or 4 thats still  a few of the same type of a toy he's obsessed in multiple colors that can be lined up and counted. We work with him on this every day and he's gotten so much better, but he's still a challenge and he's only 3.
Someone taking his buses or his rubber wheels he uses as finger puppets is a great way to have a whole day meltdown. He won't give up. he won't concede. He'll just flip his lid and get stressed and it's just going to be horrible for all. 
Do I ask them to not bring a bunch? Do I get one or two more so he has his own to line up? Do i just make him deal? He's meeting 10 new people, we're going to be outside when he hates getting dirty and hates leaves and he won't be sleeping in his own bed. It's a lot to ask from him as it is and we're only staying one day, but this feels like it's too much. 2 more dolls wold be about $70ish dollars, $25 if he'll go for the cheaper dolls from Hobby Lobby. I'm not going to count on thrifting more dolls as I'm sure that was just a lucky break.



On the other hand, who am I to dictate what toys they can bring? I understand how crazy that sounds and if it were me and I had no real idea about Autism I'd be mad that someone even suggested it. 


This toy is one of the things on his list that he WONT compromise one. He won't budge, he won't stop, he won't leave it be. We've been practicing walking down the aisle and even that is insane. Our behaviorist suggested to take small steps at a time and don't push him to fast too hard. We're camping in less than a month.
Ugh this is a hard thing and I don't know what to do. I just know we have to go. He can't be in a bubble and needs to get out into the world but I don't know where to draw the line.


I don't want an angry Gus banging his head on the floor but i don't want to be THAT crazy mom. I kind of just want to stay home, but they're coming 8ish hours in the heat.

You are being a spineless doormat.

Hitch up your big girls panties, protect you son from this insanity and say no. No to all of it.

And if your husband has an issue, tell him ""She who blows him trumps she who birthed him and if you have an issue, go sleep with your mommy."" 

These people are gross, they're raising entitled kids and are entitled themselves. Your MIL is playing hideous favourites and this is all set up so your son fails so they have an understandable reason to avoid visits in future, because right now, they feel a little guilty in their cold, dead hearts, so they want this to suck, so make themselves feel better. 

Don't go. Just don't. ",14,"My son, Gus, is 3 and he has a new toy that he loves and it's a real toy. It's not the caps of markers, tires off of toy cars, water bottles or pictures of buses he lines up. It's a real toy.He uses it appropriately too. I'm so damn happy.


It's one of those Target brand 18 inch dolls. I bought one for my niece for her birthday and my son saw it and instantly wanted it He's autistic, low verbal and doesn't speak unpromped very often so  when he started saying ""Open. This this. Gus want"" it was hard for me not to open it, but i was scared he just liked the color of the box. Also, it wasn't for him and he just doesn't get stuff becasue his meltdowns wear me out and give me bruises. The meltdown was epic and lasted a long time.


The next day I went out and found one at a thrift store for $2 in great shape, but naked. I bought it some footless preemie pajamas just like his and we brought it out during speech. That day he learned the word 'dolly' and uses it appropriately and regularly.


He takes it with him and it sits and watches him line up his buses and he likes to sing the song ""Daddy Finger"" over and over and he uses the dolls hands to do it too. His way he wants anyone to 'play' with him is for them to just watch what he's doing and not move. I love it. This doll is the perfect playmate.



My husband's family is coming to visit to essentially meet Gus for the first time. They have little understanding about autism and are not big planners, so we found out that they're camping 45 minutes from town. My son hates dirt, is scared of leaves and the wind, is a runner and has learned to climb fences and doesn't look back or have 'stranger danger', so this is going to be the most stressful thing for him AND us. He self harms when he's too stressed (bangs his head) and doesn't feel pain, so he'd go full force on concrete if we let him. We've transitioned him to jumping on a trampoline instead of head banging and it's fucking amazing but we can't bring that with us.



My SIL has 2 girls that are 2 and 7. They love American Girl dolls and have about 20 or more. They only have American Girl dolls and they take them everywhere.  They're young and all young kids have issues sharing, but the older one threw a gift we got her across the room becasue it was the wrong color. She doesn't share well and my SIL has a more lax idea on parenting in general. 
Now, I totally see an issue. Even if they only bring 3 or 4 thats still  a few of the same type of a toy he's obsessed in multiple colors that can be lined up and counted. We work with him on this every day and he's gotten so much better, but he's still a challenge and he's only 3.
Someone taking his buses or his rubber wheels he uses as finger puppets is a great way to have a whole day meltdown. He won't give up. he won't concede. He'll just flip his lid and get stressed and it's just going to be horrible for all. 
Do I ask them to not bring a bunch? Do I get one or two more so he has his own to line up? Do i just make him deal? He's meeting 10 new people, we're going to be outside when he hates getting dirty and hates leaves and he won't be sleeping in his own bed. It's a lot to ask from him as it is and we're only staying one day, but this feels like it's too much. 2 more dolls wold be about $70ish dollars, $25 if he'll go for the cheaper dolls from Hobby Lobby. I'm not going to count on thrifting more dolls as I'm sure that was just a lucky break.



On the other hand, who am I to dictate what toys they can bring? I understand how crazy that sounds and if it were me and I had no real idea about Autism I'd be mad that someone even suggested it. 


This toy is one of the things on his list that he WONT compromise one. He won't budge, he won't stop, he won't leave it be. We've been practicing walking down the aisle and even that is insane. Our behaviorist suggested to take small steps at a time and don't push him to fast too hard. We're camping in less than a month.
Ugh this is a hard thing and I don't know what to do. I just know we have to go. He can't be in a bubble and needs to get out into the world but I don't know where to draw the line.

Asking your nieces to leave all but one doll each in the car or at the campsite for the day isn't outrageous.  After all, you'll be seeing/doing a specific activity instead of just hanging out at a campsite to watch your kid be miserable while his cousins play with toys ill-suited to the outdoors.

You don't even have to say anything in advance.  When they get in town, invite them to do things on your turf or in good settings for your son.  If they insist on the campsite, then send your husband with your regrets that you and Gus just couldn't make it.  If they want to leave an event to go to the campsite with you, say, ""Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.  We're headed home for tonight.""

If they're pushy, ""Camping isn't a good fit for us right now.  We'll see you tomorrow when you come to [insert event or location here].""  Then walk away.

The next day I went out and found one at a thrift store for $2 in great shape, but naked. I bought it some footless preemie pajamas just like his and we brought it out during speech. That day he learned the word 'dolly' and uses it appropriately and regularly.


He takes it with him and it sits and watches him line up his buses and he likes to sing the song ""Daddy Finger"" over and over and he uses the dolls hands to do it too. His way he wants anyone to 'play' with him is for them to just watch what he's doing and not move. I love it. This doll is the perfect playmate.



My husband's family is coming to visit to essentially meet Gus for the first time. They have little understanding about autism and are not big planners, so we found out that they're camping 45 minutes from town. My son hates dirt, is scared of leaves and the wind, is a runner and has learned to climb fences and doesn't look back or have 'stranger danger', so this is going to be the most stressful thing for him AND us. He self harms when he's too stressed (bangs his head) and doesn't feel pain, so he'd go full force on concrete if we let him. We've transitioned him to jumping on a trampoline instead of head banging and it's fucking amazing but we can't bring that with us.



My SIL has 2 girls that are 2 and 7. They love American Girl dolls and have about 20 or more. They only have American Girl dolls and they take them everywhere.  They're young and all young kids have issues sharing, but the older one threw a gift we got her across the room becasue it was the wrong color. She doesn't share well and my SIL has a more lax idea on parenting in general. 
Now, I totally see an issue. Even if they only bring 3 or 4 thats still  a few of the same type of a toy he's obsessed in multiple colors that can be lined up and counted. We work with him on this every day and he's gotten so much better, but he's still a challenge and he's only 3.
Someone taking his buses or his rubber wheels he uses as finger puppets is a great way to have a whole day meltdown. He won't give up. he won't concede. He'll just flip his lid and get stressed and it's just going to be horrible for all. 
Do I ask them to not bring a bunch? Do I get one or two more so he has his own to line up? Do i just make him deal? He's meeting 10 new people, we're going to be outside when he hates getting dirty and hates leaves and he won't be sleeping in his own bed. It's a lot to ask from him as it is and we're only staying one day, but this feels like it's too much. 2 more dolls wold be about $70ish dollars, $25 if he'll go for the cheaper dolls from Hobby Lobby. I'm not going to count on thrifting more dolls as I'm sure that was just a lucky break.



On the other hand, who am I to dictate what toys they can bring? I understand how crazy that sounds and if it were me and I had no real idea about Autism I'd be mad that someone even suggested it. 


This toy is one of the things on his list that he WONT compromise one. He won't budge, he won't stop, he won't leave it be. We've been practicing walking down the aisle and even that is insane. Our behaviorist suggested to take small steps at a time and don't push him to fast too hard. We're camping in less than a month.
Ugh this is a hard thing and I don't know what to do. I just know we have to go. He can't be in a bubble and needs to get out into the world but I don't know where to draw the line.


I don't want an angry Gus banging his head on the floor but i don't want to be THAT crazy mom. I kind of just want to stay home, but they're coming 8ish hours in the heat.

566,t3_69b77z,ChaoticCwtsh,"Write your SIL an email explaining the situation. That Gus has his own new doll that is helping him greatly, but you don't want to upset him and upset the girls over something like this, especially in an already overwhelming new situation. Ask if she'd be amendable to having the girls leave their dolls behind - or safely in the car away from dirt - and instead getting some 'new' outdoor toys for them to play with together?

You could go with cars that push in the dirt, those rubber bouncing balls they sell in the summer section that are a bit smaller than a basket ball. Summer toys, 'new toys to play with together' so no one gets jealous over whose toys are whose. You can pick up a lot at thrift stores, or cheap at dollar stores.

Maybe something like that could allow them to play together, or at least play side by side without tears.

"
569,t3_69b77z,Crafty_mom,"I agree with another post about getting more outdoor geared toys for the camping and asking your nieces to keep their dolls in the trailer. 

You could get a little bubble machine at a toy store which keeps my kids entertained forever.  It's also something that no one needs to touch. It stays stationary, so it'll be easier to relay that rule to all the kids. 

The age of three is a tough age for a neurotypical child, for a special needs child it can be pretty brutal. 
Our son is diagnosed, and at that age would headbang, cry out ""ouch"" and would struggle to bolt into traffic. It was an extremely stressful time. There are thing you can try to curb the behaviours, but I think it's important to accept that it's going to happen regardless. 

From reading this post (and from my own experiences) my concern comes from this being the first time your son is meeting this side of the family. Do they know about the diagnosis? Are the sceptical of it? Do they tend to be judgemental about parenting and kids in general? 
My family never believed my son was on the spectrum while we were waiting for diagnosis. They said he needed to be spanked, and that he didn't fear me enough. We got the whole ""he's an only child"" bit, and it was heavily implied that we were bad parents. 

My first instinct reading this is to be on the defence and to speak with your SO about having an exit plan if your family is less than supportive.. 

Edit to add: 
Don't bring the dolls. 
Our son has obsession toys, too. 
We have one or two he can choose between as a security toy that he doesn't need to share. Obviously the doll is going to be a trigger. If you're asking them to keep the dolls away, then maybe secretly pack one for him incase they decide to drag them out. Don't let him know you have it. It should be an emergency measure. 
Instead pick one toy that he likes, but doesn't obsess over. 
If a toy is trigger worthy, we never let him take it out of the house. Too risky. Instead he will have a favourite.. maybe something related, but not the same, and nothing too big. I think as our son has gotten older it's helped that we've restricted his security toys to a modest size.",7,"My son, Gus, is 3 and he has a new toy that he loves and it's a real toy.

I bought one for my niece for her birthday and my son saw it and instantly wanted it He's autistic, low verbal and doesn't speak unpromped very often so  when he started saying ""Open. This this. Gus want"" it was hard for me not to open it, but i was scared he just liked the color of the box. Also, it wasn't for him and he just doesn't get stuff becasue his meltdowns wear me out and give me bruises. The meltdown was epic and lasted a long time.


The next day I went out and found one at a thrift store for $2 in great shape, but naked. I bought it some footless preemie pajamas just like his and we brought it out during speech. That day he learned the word 'dolly' and uses it appropriately and regularly.


He takes it with him and it sits and watches him line up his buses and he likes to sing the song ""Daddy Finger"" over and over and he uses the dolls hands to do it too. His way he wants anyone to 'play' with him is for them to just watch what he's doing and not move. I love it. This doll is the perfect playmate.



My husband's family is coming to visit to essentially meet Gus for the first time. They have little understanding about autism and are not big planners, so we found out that they're camping 45 minutes from town. My son hates dirt, is scared of leaves and the wind, is a runner and has learned to climb fences and doesn't look back or have 'stranger danger', so this is going to be the most stressful thing for him AND us. He self harms when he's too stressed (bangs his head) and doesn't feel pain, so he'd go full force on concrete if we let him. We've transitioned him to jumping on a trampoline instead of head banging and it's fucking amazing but we can't bring that with us.



My SIL has 2 girls that are 2 and 7. They love American Girl dolls and have about 20 or more. They only have American Girl dolls and they take them everywhere.  They're young and all young kids have issues sharing, but the older one threw a gift we got her across the room becasue it was the wrong color. She doesn't share well and my SIL has a more lax idea on parenting in general. 
Now, I totally see an issue. Even if they only bring 3 or 4 thats still  a few of the same type of a toy he's obsessed in multiple colors that can be lined up and counted. We work with him on this every day and he's gotten so much better, but he's still a challenge and he's only 3.
Someone taking his buses or his rubber wheels he uses as finger puppets is a great way to have a whole day meltdown. He won't give up. he won't concede. He'll just flip his lid and get stressed and it's just going to be horrible for all. 
Do I ask them to not bring a bunch? Do I get one or two more so he has his own to line up? Do i just make him deal? He's meeting 10 new people, we're going to be outside when he hates getting dirty and hates leaves and he won't be sleeping in his own bed. It's a lot to ask from him as it is and we're only staying one day, but this feels like it's too much. 2 more dolls wold be about $70ish dollars, $25 if he'll go for the cheaper dolls from Hobby Lobby. I'm not going to count on thrifting more dolls as I'm sure that was just a lucky break.



On the other hand, who am I to dictate what toys they can bring? I understand how crazy that sounds and if it were me and I had no real idea about Autism I'd be mad that someone even suggested it. 


This toy is one of the things on his list that he WONT compromise one. He won't budge, he won't stop, he won't leave it be. We've been practicing walking down the aisle and even that is insane. Our behaviorist suggested to take small steps at a time and don't push him to fast too hard. We're camping in less than a month.
Ugh this is a hard thing and I don't know what to do. I just know we have to go. He can't be in a bubble and needs to get out into the world but I don't know where to draw the line.


I don't want an angry Gus banging his head on the floor but i don't want to be THAT crazy mom. I kind of just want to stay home, but they're coming 8ish hours in the heat.

573,t3_69b77z,bemzilla,I think you would be better off to have the family visit you and your son at your house then let your husband go camping for the night with his family while you two stay home.

I refused to drive 8+ hours to visit my husband's family with a infant-now-toddler as they've never come out in the 10 years we've been together and WE ALWAYS GO. So we waited for them to come and this will be the 1st time he will see his folks in 2 years.

His way he wants anyone to 'play' with him is for them to just watch what he's doing and not move. I love it. This doll is the perfect playmate.



My husband's family is coming to visit to essentially meet Gus for the first time. They have little understanding about autism and are not big planners, so we found out that they're camping 45 minutes from town. My son hates dirt, is scared of leaves and the wind, is a runner and has learned to climb fences and doesn't look back or have 'stranger danger', so this is going to be the most stressful thing for him AND us. He self harms when he's too stressed (bangs his head) and doesn't feel pain, so he'd go full force on concrete if we let him. We've transitioned him to jumping on a trampoline instead of head banging and it's fucking amazing but we can't bring that with us.



My SIL has 2 girls that are 2 and 7. They love American Girl dolls and have about 20 or more. They only have American Girl dolls and they take them everywhere.  They're young and all young kids have issues sharing, but the older one threw a gift we got her across the room becasue it was the wrong color. She doesn't share well and my SIL has a more lax idea on parenting in general. 
Now, I totally see an issue. Even if they only bring 3 or 4 thats still  a few of the same type of a toy he's obsessed in multiple colors that can be lined up and counted. We work with him on this every day and he's gotten so much better, but he's still a challenge and he's only 3.
Someone taking his buses or his rubber wheels he uses as finger puppets is a great way to have a whole day meltdown. He won't give up. he won't concede. He'll just flip his lid and get stressed and it's just going to be horrible for all. 
Do I ask them to not bring a bunch? Do I get one or two more so he has his own to line up? Do i just make him deal? He's meeting 10 new people, we're going to be outside when he hates getting dirty and hates leaves and he won't be sleeping in his own bed. It's a lot to ask from him as it is and we're only staying one day, but this feels like it's too much. 2 more dolls wold be about $70ish dollars, $25 if he'll go for the cheaper dolls from Hobby Lobby. I'm not going to count on thrifting more dolls as I'm sure that was just a lucky break.



On the other hand, who am I to dictate what toys they can bring? I understand how crazy that sounds and if it were me and I had no real idea about Autism I'd be mad that someone even suggested it. 


This toy is one of the things on his list that he WONT compromise one. He won't budge, he won't stop, he won't leave it be. We've been practicing walking down the aisle and even that is insane. Our behaviorist suggested to take small steps at a time and don't push him to fast too hard. We're camping in less than a month.
Ugh this is a hard thing and I don't know what to do. I just know we have to go. He can't be in a bubble and needs to get out into the world but I don't know where to draw the line.


I don't want an angry Gus banging his head on the floor but i don't want to be THAT crazy mom. I kind of just want to stay home, but they're coming 8ish hours in the heat.

581,t3_69b77z,TheHatOnTheCat,"It's perfectly fine they are camping but they then can drive to your house and meet Gus there. Gus will not be going camping. He will be miserable and **it's not safe for him.** Do not bring a self-harming toddler runner to a place you know will upset him and cause him to bolt into the wilderness and self harm. Seriously. This is not a negotiation with husband and his family. It's a no.

Your husband can go pick them up and drive them to your house to meet your son. If they don't want to come they can not meet him? 

You and your husband are your son's only advocates and protectors. If he won't stand up to his family you need to stand up to his family for him. And to him. 

I'd understand if you were just making Gus miserable for a day to benefit 10 other family members. Sometimes kids have to deal, even kids with ASD. Some days are just rough. But this is not going to make anyone's day better. Bringing Gus to the campsite will make everyone miserable, not just Gus. A screaming ASD child meltdown is not something people not familiar with want to deal with and won't be more fun then a 45 minute drive. This isn't being considerate it's being stupid. Also, if he starts head banging and you can't redirect to trampoline they may be shocked as might their children. And if he runs away into the woods . . . yeah. 

Please go stand up for Gus now. Also, for just not setting the whole family visit up for horrible miserable failure for everyone. So also just for not stupidity.

We've transitioned him to jumping on a trampoline instead of head banging and it's fucking amazing but we can't bring that with us.



My SIL has 2 girls that are 2 and 7. They love American Girl dolls and have about 20 or more. They only have American Girl dolls and they take them everywhere.  They're young and all young kids have issues sharing, but the older one threw a gift we got her across the room becasue it was the wrong color. She doesn't share well and my SIL has a more lax idea on parenting in general. 
Now, I totally see an issue. Even if they only bring 3 or 4 thats still  a few of the same type of a toy he's obsessed in multiple colors that can be lined up and counted. We work with him on this every day and he's gotten so much better, but he's still a challenge and he's only 3.
Someone taking his buses or his rubber wheels he uses as finger puppets is a great way to have a whole day meltdown. He won't give up. he won't concede. He'll just flip his lid and get stressed and it's just going to be horrible for all. 
Do I ask them to not bring a bunch? Do I get one or two more so he has his own to line up? Do i just make him deal? He's meeting 10 new people, we're going to be outside when he hates getting dirty and hates leaves and he won't be sleeping in his own bed. It's a lot to ask from him as it is and we're only staying one day, but this feels like it's too much. 2 more dolls wold be about $70ish dollars, $25 if he'll go for the cheaper dolls from Hobby Lobby. I'm not going to count on thrifting more dolls as I'm sure that was just a lucky break.



On the other hand, who am I to dictate what toys they can bring? I understand how crazy that sounds and if it were me and I had no real idea about Autism I'd be mad that someone even suggested it. 


This toy is one of the things on his list that he WONT compromise one. He won't budge, he won't stop, he won't leave it be. We've been practicing walking down the aisle and even that is insane. Our behaviorist suggested to take small steps at a time and don't push him to fast too hard. We're camping in less than a month.
Ugh this is a hard thing and I don't know what to do. I just know we have to go. He can't be in a bubble and needs to get out into the world but I don't know where to draw the line.


I don't want an angry Gus banging his head on the floor but i don't want to be THAT crazy mom. I kind of just want to stay home, but they're coming 8ish hours in the heat.


"
584,t3_69b77z,your_moms_a_clone,"Look, you need to put your son's needs above your family's unreasonable demands. Gus is on the spectrum, and even if he wasn't, camping with a 3 year old can be very difficult and overstimulating. 

He's 3. He's not likely to even remember meeting these people in the future. 

Your husband's family is being selfish. Your HUSBAND is being selfish. No one is considering Gus's needs here. So that falls to you. Don't take Gus camping. No one else is advocating for him, so YOU have to. This is going to be a lifelong battle for Gus (and you, until if and when he's able to manage on his own), so it's best to start getting used to it now. ",6,"My son, Gus, is 3 and he has a new toy that he loves and it's a real toy. It's not the caps of markers, tires off of toy cars, water bottles or pictures of buses he lines up. It's a real toy.He uses it appropriately too. I'm so damn happy.


It's one of those Target brand 18 inch dolls. I bought one for my niece for her birthday and my son saw it and instantly wanted it He's autistic, low verbal and doesn't speak unpromped very often so  when he started saying ""Open. This this. Gus want"" it was hard for me not to open it, but i was scared he just liked the color of the box. Also, it wasn't for him and he just doesn't get stuff becasue his meltdowns wear me out and give me bruises. The meltdown was epic and lasted a long time.


The next day I went out and found one at a thrift store for $2 in great shape, but naked. I bought it some footless preemie pajamas just like his and we brought it out during speech. That day he learned the word 'dolly' and uses it appropriately and regularly.


He takes it with him and it sits and watches him line up his buses and he likes to sing the song ""Daddy Finger"" over and over and he uses the dolls hands to do it too. His way he wants anyone to 'play' with him is for them to just watch what he's doing and not move. I love it. This doll is the perfect playmate.



My husband's family is coming to visit to essentially meet Gus for the first time. They have little understanding about autism and are not big planners, so we found out that they're camping 45 minutes from town. My son hates dirt, is scared of leaves and the wind, is a runner and has learned to climb fences and doesn't look back or have 'stranger danger', so this is going to be the most stressful thing for him AND us.

586,t3_69b77z,izfiz,"Um. Why do you have to go, again? Send him. It's not just you putting yourself out for your husband's inability to stand up to his family. It's you risking your son's health, happiness, and safety to cater to people who likely aren't going to understand him anyway. 

If you do ""have to"" go because you can't say no to your husband who can't say no to his family, well, fuck their AG dolls. Tell them to keep them away, and if they don't, let Gus be Gus and they'll never invite you back again. Sounds like a win for you and Gus both.

Do I ask them to not bring a bunch? Do I get one or two more so he has his own to line up? Do i just make him deal? He's meeting 10 new people, we're going to be outside when he hates getting dirty and hates leaves and he won't be sleeping in his own bed. It's a lot to ask from him as it is and we're only staying one day, but this feels like it's too much. 2 more dolls wold be about $70ish dollars, $25 if he'll go for the cheaper dolls from Hobby Lobby. I'm not going to count on thrifting more dolls as I'm sure that was just a lucky break.



On the other hand, who am I to dictate what toys they can bring? I understand how crazy that sounds and if it were me and I had no real idea about Autism I'd be mad that someone even suggested it. 


This toy is one of the things on his list that he WONT compromise one. He won't budge, he won't stop, he won't leave it be. We've been practicing walking down the aisle and even that is insane. Our behaviorist suggested to take small steps at a time and don't push him to fast too hard. We're camping in less than a month.
Ugh this is a hard thing and I don't know what to do. I just know we have to go. He can't be in a bubble and needs to get out into the world but I don't know where to draw the line.


I don't want an angry Gus banging his head on the floor but i don't want to be THAT crazy mom. I kind of just want to stay home, but they're coming 8ish hours in the heat.

590,t3_69b77z,lightningSoup,"So he's not ready to stand up to his parents, instead he just puts your son in a horrible situation that will be very upsetting to him?

He would rather have your son suffer than hurt his parents feelings?

Maybe your husband needs to rethink his priorities. He is making the wrong decision here. If he can't tell his parents no then you can refuse to participate in this. There is no way in hell I would go in this situation. ",1,"My son, Gus, is 3 and he has a new toy that he loves and it's a real toy. It's not the caps of markers, tires off of toy cars, water bottles or pictures of buses he lines up. It's a real toy.He uses it appropriately too. I'm so damn happy.


It's one of those Target brand 18 inch dolls. I bought one for my niece for her birthday and my son saw it and instantly wanted it He's autistic, low verbal and doesn't speak unpromped very often so  when he started saying ""Open. This this. Gus want"" it was hard for me not to open it, but i was scared he just liked the color of the box. Also, it wasn't for him and he just doesn't get stuff becasue his meltdowns wear me out and give me bruises. The meltdown was epic and lasted a long time.


The next day I went out and found one at a thrift store for $2 in great shape, but naked. I bought it some footless preemie pajamas just like his and we brought it out during speech. That day he learned the word 'dolly' and uses it appropriately and regularly.


He takes it with him and it sits and watches him line up his buses and he likes to sing the song ""Daddy Finger"" over and over and he uses the dolls hands to do it too. His way he wants anyone to 'play' with him is for them to just watch what he's doing and not move. I love it. This doll is the perfect playmate.



My husband's family is coming to visit to essentially meet Gus for the first time. They have little understanding about autism and are not big planners, so we found out that they're camping 45 minutes from town. My son hates dirt, is scared of leaves and the wind, is a runner and has learned to climb fences and doesn't look back or have 'stranger danger', so this is going to be the most stressful thing for him AND us. He self harms when he's too stressed (bangs his head) and doesn't feel pain, so he'd go full force on concrete if we let him. We've transitioned him to jumping on a trampoline instead of head banging and it's fucking amazing but we can't bring that with us.



My SIL has 2 girls that are 2 and 7. They love American Girl dolls and have about 20 or more. They only have American Girl dolls and they take them everywhere.  They're young and all young kids have issues sharing, but the older one threw a gift we got her across the room becasue it was the wrong color. She doesn't share well and my SIL has a more lax idea on parenting in general.

Ugh this is a hard thing and I don't know what to do. I just know we have to go. He can't be in a bubble and needs to get out into the world but I don't know where to draw the line.


I don't want an angry Gus banging his head on the floor but i don't want to be THAT crazy mom. I kind of just want to stay home, but they're coming 8ish hours in the heat.

596,t3_69b77z,ChaoticCwtsh,"""Gus has recently discovered a toy that he really likes. This toy is helping him make progress, but he does still have issues with possessiveness over toys, and over multiples of things. I'm certain if your girls show up with as many dolls as they normally bring with them, it will upset or overstimulate him to the point of tears, and he'll want them. Would it be possible to ask you to limit the girls to maybe one each for this trip only? Just until he's older and can understand that each persons toys are their own."" 

Maybe something like that? Only obviously with more details that fit your situation, some emphasis that you're not trying to control her or her girls/not commenting on her parenting, but simply want the situation to go smoothly for all kids and family.

",10,"My son, Gus, is 3 and he has a new toy that he loves and it's a real toy. It's not the caps of markers, tires off of toy cars, water bottles or pictures of buses he lines up. It's a real toy.He uses it appropriately too. I'm so damn happy.


It's one of those Target brand 18 inch dolls. I bought one for my niece for her birthday and my son saw it and instantly wanted it He's autistic, low verbal and doesn't speak unpromped very often so  when he started saying ""Open. This this. Gus want"" it was hard for me not to open it, but i was scared he just liked the color of the box. Also, it wasn't for him and he just doesn't get stuff becasue his meltdowns wear me out and give me bruises. The meltdown was epic and lasted a long time.


The next day I went out and found one at a thrift store for $2 in great shape, but naked. I bought it some footless preemie pajamas just like his and we brought it out during speech. That day he learned the word 'dolly' and uses it appropriately and regularly.


He takes it with him and it sits and watches him line up his buses and he likes to sing the song ""Daddy Finger"" over and over and he uses the dolls hands to do it too. His way he wants anyone to 'play' with him is for them to just watch what he's doing and not move. I love it. This doll is the perfect playmate.



My husband's family is coming to visit to essentially meet Gus for the first time. They have little understanding about autism and are not big planners, so we found out that they're camping 45 minutes from town. My son hates dirt, is scared of leaves and the wind, is a runner and has learned to climb fences and doesn't look back or have 'stranger danger', so this is going to be the most stressful thing for him AND us. He self harms when he's too stressed (bangs his head) and doesn't feel pain, so he'd go full force on concrete if we let him. We've transitioned him to jumping on a trampoline instead of head banging and it's fucking amazing but we can't bring that with us.



My SIL has 2 girls that are 2 and 7. They love American Girl dolls and have about 20 or more. They only have American Girl dolls and they take them everywhere.  They're young and all young kids have issues sharing, but the older one threw a gift we got her across the room becasue it was the wrong color. She doesn't share well and my SIL has a more lax idea on parenting in general. 
Now, I totally see an issue. Even if they only bring 3 or 4 thats still  a few of the same type of a toy he's obsessed in multiple colors that can be lined up and counted. We work with him on this every day and he's gotten so much better, but he's still a challenge and he's only 3.
Someone taking his buses or his rubber wheels he uses as finger puppets is a great way to have a whole day meltdown. He won't give up. he won't concede. He'll just flip his lid and get stressed and it's just going to be horrible for all. 
Do I ask them to not bring a bunch? Do I get one or two more so he has his own to line up? Do i just make him deal? He's meeting 10 new people, we're going to be outside when he hates getting dirty and hates leaves and he won't be sleeping in his own bed. It's a lot to ask from him as it is and we're only staying one day, but this feels like it's too much. 2 more dolls wold be about $70ish dollars, $25 if he'll go for the cheaper dolls from Hobby Lobby. I'm not going to count on thrifting more dolls as I'm sure that was just a lucky break.



On the other hand, who am I to dictate what toys they can bring? I understand how crazy that sounds and if it were me and I had no real idea about Autism I'd be mad that someone even suggested it.

597,t3_69b77z,gingervitis13,"Yeah, this is my thinking. They're coming to visit you, but chose to stay 45 minutes away from you. That doesn't mean you go stay with them 45 minutes away. That means, every day, they drive 45 minutes to see you. Maybe a few days of their stay, you drive out to them, but that hour and half is their problem. 

For what it's worth, my parents do this sometimes. They have three dogs and we have two, which is just too many to stay with us. Sometimes they can find an air bnb that allows dogs near us, but usually if they have to bring all three they end up camping about 45 minutes away. We'll go see them and spend time at the state park where they camp, but mostly they drive into town to see us. They're fine with it. They get my reasons and accept them.

Can't they just camp from noon-dinner and leave?",2,"My son, Gus, is 3 and he has a new toy that he loves and it's a real toy. It's not the caps of markers, tires off of toy cars, water bottles or pictures of buses he lines up. It's a real toy.He uses it appropriately too. I'm so damn happy.


It's one of those Target brand 18 inch dolls. I bought one for my niece for her birthday and my son saw it and instantly wanted it He's autistic, low verbal and doesn't speak unpromped very often so  when he started saying ""Open. This this. Gus want"" it was hard for me not to open it, but i was scared he just liked the color of the box. Also, it wasn't for him and he just doesn't get stuff becasue his meltdowns wear me out and give me bruises. The meltdown was epic and lasted a long time.


The next day I went out and found one at a thrift store for $2 in great shape, but naked. I bought it some footless preemie pajamas just like his and we brought it out during speech. That day he learned the word 'dolly' and uses it appropriately and regularly.


He takes it with him and it sits and watches him line up his buses and he likes to sing the song ""Daddy Finger"" over and over and he uses the dolls hands to do it too. His way he wants anyone to 'play' with him is for them to just watch what he's doing and not move. I love it. This doll is the perfect playmate.



My husband's family is coming to visit to essentially meet Gus for the first time. They have little understanding about autism and are not big planners, so we found out that they're camping 45 minutes from town. My son hates dirt, is scared of leaves and the wind, is a runner and has learned to climb fences and doesn't look back or have 'stranger danger', so this is going to be the most stressful thing for him AND us. He self harms when he's too stressed (bangs his head) and doesn't feel pain, so he'd go full force on concrete if we let him. We've transitioned him to jumping on a trampoline instead of head banging and it's fucking amazing but we can't bring that with us.



My SIL has 2 girls that are 2 and 7. They love American Girl dolls and have about 20 or more. They only have American Girl dolls and they take them everywhere.  They're young and all young kids have issues sharing, but the older one threw a gift we got her across the room becasue it was the wrong color. She doesn't share well and my SIL has a more lax idea on parenting in general. 
Now, I totally see an issue. Even if they only bring 3 or 4 thats still  a few of the same type of a toy he's obsessed in multiple colors that can be lined up and counted. We work with him on this every day and he's gotten so much better, but he's still a challenge and he's only 3.
Someone taking his buses or his rubber wheels he uses as finger puppets is a great way to have a whole day meltdown. He won't give up. he won't concede. He'll just flip his lid and get stressed and it's just going to be horrible for all. 
Do I ask them to not bring a bunch? Do I get one or two more so he has his own to line up? Do i just make him deal? He's meeting 10 new people, we're going to be outside when he hates getting dirty and hates leaves and he won't be sleeping in his own bed. It's a lot to ask from him as it is and we're only staying one day, but this feels like it's too much. 2 more dolls wold be about $70ish dollars, $25 if he'll go for the cheaper dolls from Hobby Lobby. I'm not going to count on thrifting more dolls as I'm sure that was just a lucky break.



On the other hand, who am I to dictate what toys they can bring? I understand how crazy that sounds and if it were me and I had no real idea about Autism I'd be mad that someone even suggested it. 


This toy is one of the things on his list that he WONT compromise one. He won't budge, he won't stop, he won't leave it be. We've been practicing walking down the aisle and even that is insane. Our behaviorist suggested to take small steps at a time and don't push him to fast too hard. We're camping in less than a month.
Ugh this is a hard thing and I don't know what to do. I just know we have to go. He can't be in a bubble and needs to get out into the world but I don't know where to draw the line.


I don't want an angry Gus banging his head on the floor but i don't want to be THAT crazy mom. I kind of just want to stay home, but they're coming 8ish hours in the heat.

603,t3_69b77z,TheHatOnTheCat,"My parents do this when visiting my brother. They stay at an air BnB or a campsite (they don't love hotels and he lives in an area close to beautiful nature) and then they drive over to see his place, shows, restaurants, whatever. They don't meet at their campsite.

This is why I said it's fine they are camping. There is literately zero issue with that. Gus just isn't visiting the camp site. And husband can spend some extra time with them at the camp site if he wants without Gus. If they don't go to OP's home every day that's okay, every day might be too much for Gus anyway.

604,t3_54x2as,nyoprinces,"This doesn't sound like a good daycare for him. It sounds like he needs to be someplace that has more kids his age, and where they're better trained to deal with behavior in a developmentally appropriate way. It sounds like the current daycare is treating all of the kids as if they're the same age, which doesn't work well for the youngest - even something as small as offering markers to a 19-month-old, when markers aren't really appropriate until they're 2 or so and able to understand how to only color on paper. A larger facility, with classes equipped for correct ages, might be a really good fit for him.",122,"My 19 month old son has some temper issues. 

Twice in the last 2 weeks, my daycare lady has pulled me aside to tell me that my son, who is the youngest of about 5 kids at daycare (max age almost 3) regularly hits, pushes, pulls at, and steals toys from all the other kids. He apparently pulled down a 2 yo boy the size of a 4 yo all the way to the ground and the kid hit his head on something. Not good.

They have been putting him on time-outs, 2-3 times a day. It has not done anything to change his behavior.

Most of the time when he takes a toy from someone and they catch him, they order him to give it back and he complies without issue. He then will usually grin and clap for himself for doing such a good thing. =/

Today, daycare lady said that he has stopped listening when they tell him to give stuff back or do anything. He is getting worse and throwing fits more and more when he gets scolded. Example she gave today: the kids were all drawing, he wanted to hold a bunch of markers at once, they told him only one at a time, he threw a maaaassive tantrum.

She wants us to be ""working on his behavior at home,"" but I'm not sure how. He is much better behaved at home. When we have playdates with other kids, he never hits them or steals their toys. And if he ever did, we would never just let him do it without discipline. (Note: we don't spank, and we have not yet done timeouts - I have doubts about their effectiveness at this age.)

Some things we HAVE seen at home that are troubling: as soon as we say the words ""no"" or ""don't"" or ""stop,"" even if it's not in a stern voice, he starts either crying (normal, I guess), hitting himself with his fist, banging his head on floor, wall, or crib, or dramatically throwing himself on the floor (also common?). Or a combination of those. He also says ""Ouch! Ouch!"" as he does the self-harming behavior. It is unclear whether it actually hurts him or that's all for show, but I think he mainly wants a reaction and attention. He has been hitting himself like that in frustration/protest since before he was a year old.

This does not mean we back off - we are firm and consistent, as much as we can be. Aside from protecting our own bodies when he hits, we tell him in simple terms and a stern tone, ""No, hitting is not okay, hitting hurts,"" and that's it. We then dont reward the behavior with anymore attention as long as he's not damaging anything/anybody.

We received advice to ignore the tantrums and just look or walk away and later praise him when he is showing good behavior. This has not shown noticeable improvement yet.

So...what do I do? Is this under the realm of normal toddler behavior, or is it going too far? Is he a sociopath? It feels like my daycare is saying he's the only toddler who ever does this stuff. I hate that he's hurting other kids, and I don't know what to do about ""working on it"" if I don't see it happening.

I would move daycares.  Time outs are not appropriate for a child under 2.  Your son obviously doesn't understand.  Also, the daycare should be supervising so that your toddler isn't tackling a 4yo.

Basically, he wants to do something active.  But physically interacting with someone is hard to figure out for a toddler.  From their point of view, it didn't hurt, and it looked like what someone else did. So why did they get in trouble?

Try engaging in more big body play, but be natural in your responses.  Don't give the same ""No, hitting is not okay, hitting hurts"" to every thing he does wrong.  If it is a slight hit, tell him no, and keep playing.  If he accidentally hits you, say ouch and show him what hurt and keep playing.  If he hits you hard, stop and tell him it hurt.  You may also want your spouse to get him to apologize and see if you're ok.  You can also model good behavior if you accidentally hurt him.

Son is pretty verbal, has at least 75 words. Has very good receptive language skills - understands most things we tell him. It is mainly his behavior and social skills I worry about.

He has been at this daycare since he was 3.5 months old and never protests going there. He seems to like everybody. When he's not doing the bad stuff, he is very sweet and social."
610,t3_54x2as,Wdc331,"Sounds like you have a daycare problem. The things the daycare person describes doing are not age appropriate. At 19 months, it's still largely about redirection and monitoring to avoid putting kids in situations that aren't good. If it were me, I would look for a new daycare with staff who are familiar with and trained to work with this age group. Is that a possibility? ",6,"My 19 month old son has some temper issues. 

Twice in the last 2 weeks, my daycare lady has pulled me aside to tell me that my son, who is the youngest of about 5 kids at daycare (max age almost 3) regularly hits, pushes, pulls at, and steals toys from all the other kids. He apparently pulled down a 2 yo boy the size of a 4 yo all the way to the ground and the kid hit his head on something. Not good.

They have been putting him on time-outs, 2-3 times a day. It has not done anything to change his behavior.

Most of the time when he takes a toy from someone and they catch him, they order him to give it back and he complies without issue. He then will usually grin and clap for himself for doing such a good thing. =/

Today, daycare lady said that he has stopped listening when they tell him to give stuff back or do anything. He is getting worse and throwing fits more and more when he gets scolded. Example she gave today: the kids were all drawing, he wanted to hold a bunch of markers at once, they told him only one at a time, he threw a maaaassive tantrum.

She wants us to be ""working on his behavior at home,"" but I'm not sure how. He is much better behaved at home. When we have playdates with other kids, he never hits them or steals their toys. And if he ever did, we would never just let him do it without discipline. (Note: we don't spank, and we have not yet done timeouts - I have doubts about their effectiveness at this age.)

Some things we HAVE seen at home that are troubling: as soon as we say the words ""no"" or ""don't"" or ""stop,"" even if it's not in a stern voice, he starts either crying (normal, I guess), hitting himself with his fist, banging his head on floor, wall, or crib, or dramatically throwing himself on the floor (also common?). Or a combination of those. He also says ""Ouch! Ouch!"" as he does the self-harming behavior.

611,t3_54x2as,Pepser,"Your daycare is asking you something that is impossible. Yes, ofcourse you need to raise your kid, teach him not to hit other kids, not to steal toys, etc. But 19 months is too young to expect your parental authority to extend to within the daycare when you are not even there. 19 month old's do not think: hey let's not hit this kid because when I will be home in 4 hours my mum and dad wil not like it. Your daycare needs to adress the behavior right then and there in an age appropriate and effective way. If they can't handle a naughty toddler, it might not be the best place for a toddler. My (current) daycare has my kids behaving much better there than they do at home. Because the professionals there know what they're doing. 

 It sounds like you are doing all the right things to raise your kid at home. Also your kid sounds completely normal. They are not born raised. This takes a lot of time and effort, for you and your village! Most kids go through a tantrum phase and even 'self-harm' is pretty common. 19 months old is way to young to put a stamp of 'badly behaved' on a kid. He has only just become a toddler! 

Based on your story I do have 1 tip for addressing his behavior. You seem to be telling him a lot what *not to do* rather than what *to do*. For toddlers, preschoolers and kindergartners it helps a lot when you provide them with an alternative to the behavior they are showing, because their minibrains just can't always figure that out. So instead of 'don't steal that toy!' you can say 'I see you would really like to play with the car. Mark has that car now and feels sad when you steal it. It's better to ask him if he wants to share it with you'. Or 'I see you're angry at me. Hitting is not ok because it hurts me. It's better when you say *I'm angry!'. Then I can maybe do something about it'.",11,"My 19 month old son has some temper issues.

613,t3_54x2as,Kaitzilla,"This daycare class doesn't sound right for your little one. It can be a big transition for a child to switch daycares, maybe he can switch educators? The educator sounds a bit lazy to be honest. If eveything you are saying is true. She could just be so used to older children, young children need a lot of repititon. Perhaps she isn't following through with discussing his behavior with him. Time outs can be useless.

However, speaking as a educator who used to work in daycare. Time-outs can work at this age, IF, it is explained why they are in the time out in the first place AND followed up with a clear conversation about why the child was on a timeout and what you expect from them in the future. Ensuring that they understand is the most important part.

In daycare you can't do much else punishment wise. There are so many children just speaking with them about the misbehavior isn't enough bc they don't have time to process it and there are so many distractions. Goes in one ear and out the other.

She wants us to be ""working on his behavior at home,"" but I'm not sure how. He is much better behaved at home. When we have playdates with other kids, he never hits them or steals their toys. And if he ever did, we would never just let him do it without discipline. (Note: we don't spank, and we have not yet done timeouts - I have doubts about their effectiveness at this age.)

Some things we HAVE seen at home that are troubling: as soon as we say the words ""no"" or ""don't"" or ""stop,"" even if it's not in a stern voice, he starts either crying (normal, I guess), hitting himself with his fist, banging his head on floor, wall, or crib, or dramatically throwing himself on the floor (also common?). Or a combination of those. He also says ""Ouch! Ouch!"" as he does the self-harming behavior. It is unclear whether it actually hurts him or that's all for show, but I think he mainly wants a reaction and attention. He has been hitting himself like that in frustration/protest since before he was a year old.

This does not mean we back off - we are firm and consistent, as much as we can be. Aside from protecting our own bodies when he hits, we tell him in simple terms and a stern tone, ""No, hitting is not okay, hitting hurts,"" and that's it. We then dont reward the behavior with anymore attention as long as he's not damaging anything/anybody.

We received advice to ignore the tantrums and just look or walk away and later praise him when he is showing good behavior. This has not shown noticeable improvement yet.

So...what do I do? Is this under the realm of normal toddler behavior, or is it going too far? Is he a sociopath? It feels like my daycare is saying he's the only toddler who ever does this stuff. I hate that he's hurting other kids, and I don't know what to do about ""working on it"" if I don't see it happening.




Anticipating some questions I might get: 

We (parents) do not hit each other or argue heatedly in front of son. 

Son is pretty verbal, has at least 75 words. Has very good receptive language skills - understands most things we tell him. It is mainly his behavior and social skills I worry about.

He has been at this daycare since he was 3.5 months old and never protests going there. He seems to like everybody. When he's not doing the bad stuff, he is very sweet and social."
618,t3_54x2as,MrsLeeCorso,"Unpopular opinion: some kids can't do big daycares well. Look, any toddler is going to have temper flares and impulsive behavior and bad days. If he is consistently having them at this day care, they have not been able to modify their behavior and techniques to be able to work with your son. The fact that they are telling you to work on this at home tells me they are done trying. 

The fact is, daycare can be very stressful for kids, even kids who have had consistent daycare with the same providers and even kids who don't complain. There may be a kid there picking on him all day. There may be a teacher who is newly short on patience. Your son is clearly frustrated and can't manage his stress at this center. Maybe it's just too many kids for him to handle and he's on sensory overload. 

Now, I don't say any of these things for any sort of mommy guilt or shame. But to say your kid is not a sociopath, it's too much for him to handle right now. I'm guessing he is an only child? If so, then he goes from a calm house where he has the full attention of both parents to being one of 5 young kids who are probably pushing his buttons (or at least in his mind they are).  If possible, I would try to get him into a place that is smaller/calmer. Maybe a home based center that only has a couple of children and not all under 3. 

And give your kid some extra hugs!! He's struggling and reacting the only way he knows how. ",1,"My 19 month old son has some temper issues.

They have been putting him on time-outs, 2-3 times a day. It has not done anything to change his behavior.

Most of the time when he takes a toy from someone and they catch him, they order him to give it back and he complies without issue. He then will usually grin and clap for himself for doing such a good thing. =/

621,t3_54x2as,evanbutton,"Stay at home dad of a 19 month old boy, just wanted to chime in as we are experiencing some of the same things here at home with him and his 5 month old brother who he is getting used to. He has been going through a hitting phase for about a month now, sometimes out of frustration, sometimes to say no when he doesn't want something, sometime just for attention/get a reaction (most times) and sometimes he'll do it just so he can give a kiss immediately afterwords to say he is sorry.. the last one is kind of adorable, I just wish he knew he didn't have to whack me in the forehead to give me a smooch :)

Right now we are simply not reacting to it when he does it, unless he does it to his brother (luckily he has  only done that once). I ignore it most times cuz I believe he's only doing it to get a reaction and nothing more. 
 
I've noticed most of his tantrums or hitting happens if he hasn't been getting enough focused attention/one-on-one interaction or if he's bored, sometimes on days where we are cooped up inside or i don't take him to a playground or somewhere to expel all that energy he has! 

Just wanted to share my experience and let you know you aren't alone, and that you shouldn't worry about his behavior. From what I've read it's totally normal and it will pass, hopefully your daycare understands how to work through it as good as you as it sounds like you are handling it and working through it just fine at home. 

Edit - forgot to add that him being over tired or hungry drastically increases the chance of his tantrums/meltdowns. If his nap is thrown off or if he doesn't eat a good breakfast/lunch w.

Example she gave today: the kids were all drawing, he wanted to hold a bunch of markers at once, they told him only one at a time, he threw a maaaassive tantrum.

She wants us to be ""working on his behavior at home,"" but I'm not sure how. He is much better behaved at home. When we have playdates with other kids, he never hits them or steals their toys. And if he ever did, we would never just let him do it without discipline. (Note: we don't spank, and we have not yet done timeouts - I have doubts about their effectiveness at this age.)

Some things we HAVE seen at home that are troubling: as soon as we say the words ""no"" or ""don't"" or ""stop,"" even if it's not in a stern voice, he starts either crying (normal, I guess), hitting himself with his fist, banging his head on floor, wall, or crib, or dramatically throwing himself on the floor (also common?). Or a combination of those. He also says ""Ouch! Ouch!"" as he does the self-harming behavior. It is unclear whether it actually hurts him or that's all for show, but I think he mainly wants a reaction and attention. He has been hitting himself like that in frustration/protest since before he was a year old.

This does not mean we back off - we are firm and consistent, as much as we can be. Aside from protecting our own bodies when he hits, we tell him in simple terms and a stern tone, ""No, hitting is not okay, hitting hurts,"" and that's it. We then dont reward the behavior with anymore attention as long as he's not damaging anything/anybody.

We received advice to ignore the tantrums and just look or walk away and later praise him when he is showing good behavior. This has not shown noticeable improvement yet.

So...what do I do? Is this under the realm of normal toddler behavior, or is it going too far? Is he a sociopath? It feels like my daycare is saying he's the only toddler who ever does this stuff. I hate that he's hurting other kids, and I don't know what to do about ""working on it"" if I don't see it happening.

It's perfectly normal for a very frustrated child to hit, bite, scratch when their words fail. My guy was synonymous with biting others at daycare for awhile. Do you know what the daycare said? ""This is perfectly normal behavior for a 18 month old."" Here's how we address it here. I was more worried about it than they were. Just like your guy, he's the only one at home, so sharing and having to play with others wasn't an issue. I explained that to a caregiver at daycare and she again stated, that this is normal behavior. I think he feels that his needs or concerns are not being address and that no one hears him so he really freaks out at daycare. So I think this response might be the best.

Example she gave today: the kids were all drawing, he wanted to hold a bunch of markers at once, they told him only one at a time, he threw a maaaassive tantrum.

She wants us to be ""working on his behavior at home,"" but I'm not sure how. He is much better behaved at home. When we have playdates with other kids, he never hits them or steals their toys. And if he ever did, we would never just let him do it without discipline. (Note: we don't spank, and we have not yet done timeouts - I have doubts about their effectiveness at this age.)

Some things we HAVE seen at home that are troubling: as soon as we say the words ""no"" or ""don't"" or ""stop,"" even if it's not in a stern voice, he starts either crying (normal, I guess), hitting himself with his fist, banging his head on floor, wall, or crib, or dramatically throwing himself on the floor (also common?). Or a combination of those. He also says ""Ouch! Ouch!"" as he does the self-harming behavior. It is unclear whether it actually hurts him or that's all for show, but I think he mainly wants a reaction and attention. He has been hitting himself like that in frustration/protest since before he was a year old.

This does not mean we back off - we are firm and consistent, as much as we can be. Aside from protecting our own bodies when he hits, we tell him in simple terms and a stern tone, ""No, hitting is not okay, hitting hurts,"" and that's it. We then dont reward the behavior with anymore attention as long as he's not damaging anything/anybody.

We received advice to ignore the tantrums and just look or walk away and later praise him when he is showing good behavior. This has not shown noticeable improvement yet.

So...what do I do? Is this under the realm of normal toddler behavior, or is it going too far? Is he a sociopath? It feels like my daycare is saying he's the only toddler who ever does this stuff. I hate that he's hurting other kids, and I don't know what to do about ""working on it"" if I don't see it happening.

Also, that is a good tip, I actually do tell him what TO do most of the time because I've noticed that as well - that if I tell him e.g.  ""don't open the trashcan!"" he just grins at me and plays with it more, but if I say ""close it,"" he usually does, and I give him mild praise and he grins and walks away.

It is unclear whether it actually hurts him or that's all for show, but I think he mainly wants a reaction and attention. He has been hitting himself like that in frustration/protest since before he was a year old.

This does not mean we back off - we are firm and consistent, as much as we can be. Aside from protecting our own bodies when he hits, we tell him in simple terms and a stern tone, ""No, hitting is not okay, hitting hurts,"" and that's it. We then dont reward the behavior with anymore attention as long as he's not damaging anything/anybody.

We received advice to ignore the tantrums and just look or walk away and later praise him when he is showing good behavior. This has not shown noticeable improvement yet.

So...what do I do? Is this under the realm of normal toddler behavior, or is it going too far? Is he a sociopath? It feels like my daycare is saying he's the only toddler who ever does this stuff. I hate that he's hurting other kids, and I don't know what to do about ""working on it"" if I don't see it happening.

They have been putting him on time-outs, 2-3 times a day. It has not done anything to change his behavior.

Most of the time when he takes a toy from someone and they catch him, they order him to give it back and he complies without issue. He then will usually grin and clap for himself for doing such a good thing. =/

Today, daycare lady said that he has stopped listening when they tell him to give stuff back or do anything. He is getting worse and throwing fits more and more when he gets scolded. Example she gave today: the kids were all drawing, he wanted to hold a bunch of markers at once, they told him only one at a time, he threw a maaaassive tantrum.

They do have to learn how to control it, but time outs for a one year old are pointless. Telling him you don't like a certain behavior (we usually say ""no, thank you"") and then redirecting his attention is FAR more effective.

I also wanted to add that he may also be expressing his own frustration. If he is surrounded by older kids he may be getting ""run over"" a lot with older kids taking toys he wants, not including him, etc. I know my son sometimes experiences this with his sisters.

Son is pretty verbal, has at least 75 words. Has very good receptive language skills - understands most things we tell him. It is mainly his behavior and social skills I worry about.

He has been at this daycare since he was 3.5 months old and never protests going there. He seems to like everybody. When he's not doing the bad stuff, he is very sweet and social."
650,t3_54x2as,MrsLeeCorso,"If you have any flexibility, try to go observe sometime in the middle of the day. I hate to have him pulled out unnecessarily, so maybe if you go see what's happening you'll understand better. I would challenge the teachers to come up with some alternative strategies when your kid gets overwhelmed. Could he sit in a quiet spot and read a book? Could he watch a 10 minute video on Netflix? Could he just get some hugs and a song to calm him down? I've been thinking about your kid all day, I hope you'll update us in the future. ",1,"My 19 month old son has some temper issues. 

Twice in the last 2 weeks, my daycare lady has pulled me aside to tell me that my son, who is the youngest of about 5 kids at daycare (max age almost 3) regularly hits, pushes, pulls at, and steals toys from all the other kids. He apparently pulled down a 2 yo boy the size of a 4 yo all the way to the ground and the kid hit his head on something. Not good.

They have been putting him on time-outs, 2-3 times a day. It has not done anything to change his behavior.

Most of the time when he takes a toy from someone and they catch him, they order him to give it back and he complies without issue. He then will usually grin and clap for himself for doing such a good thing. =/

Today, daycare lady said that he has stopped listening when they tell him to give stuff back or do anything. He is getting worse and throwing fits more and more when he gets scolded. Example she gave today: the kids were all drawing, he wanted to hold a bunch of markers at once, they told him only one at a time, he threw a maaaassive tantrum.

She wants us to be ""working on his behavior at home,"" but I'm not sure how. He is much better behaved at home. When we have playdates with other kids, he never hits them or steals their toys. And if he ever did, we would never just let him do it without discipline. (Note: we don't spank, and we have not yet done timeouts - I have doubts about their effectiveness at this age.)

Some things we HAVE seen at home that are troubling: as soon as we say the words ""no"" or ""don't"" or ""stop,"" even if it's not in a stern voice, he starts either crying (normal, I guess), hitting himself with his fist, banging his head on floor, wall, or crib, or dramatically throwing himself on the floor (also common?). Or a combination of those. He also says ""Ouch! Ouch!"" as he does the self-harming behavior. It is unclear whether it actually hurts him or that's all for show, but I think he mainly wants a reaction and attention. He has been hitting himself like that in frustration/protest since before he was a year old.

This does not mean we back off - we are firm and consistent, as much as we can be. Aside from protecting our own bodies when he hits, we tell him in simple terms and a stern tone, ""No, hitting is not okay, hitting hurts,"" and that's it. We then dont reward the behavior with anymore attention as long as he's not damaging anything/anybody.

We received advice to ignore the tantrums and just look or walk away and later praise him when he is showing good behavior. This has not shown noticeable improvement yet.

So...what do I do? Is this under the realm of normal toddler behavior, or is it going too far? Is he a sociopath? It feels like my daycare is saying he's the only toddler who ever does this stuff. I hate that he's hurting other kids, and I don't know what to do about ""working on it"" if I don't see it happening.

and i always the same thing: have you had him screened by an expert in the field? pediatricians get things like this wrong more than they get them right. they are not behavioralists

as a professional, you should be aware that the diagnostic criteria for ASD in kids this young have not been perfected. so you can't just dismiss this possibility

it's your kid, you will care for him as you see fit and i guess all that can be done at this point is wait and see

Example she gave today: the kids were all drawing, he wanted to hold a bunch of markers at once, they told him only one at a time, he threw a maaaassive tantrum.

She wants us to be ""working on his behavior at home,"" but I'm not sure how. He is much better behaved at home. When we have playdates with other kids, he never hits them or steals their toys. And if he ever did, we would never just let him do it without discipline. (Note: we don't spank, and we have not yet done timeouts - I have doubts about their effectiveness at this age.)

Some things we HAVE seen at home that are troubling: as soon as we say the words ""no"" or ""don't"" or ""stop,"" even if it's not in a stern voice, he starts either crying (normal, I guess), hitting himself with his fist, banging his head on floor, wall, or crib, or dramatically throwing himself on the floor (also common?). Or a combination of those. He also says ""Ouch! Ouch!"" as he does the self-harming behavior. It is unclear whether it actually hurts him or that's all for show, but I think he mainly wants a reaction and attention. He has been hitting himself like that in frustration/protest since before he was a year old.

This does not mean we back off - we are firm and consistent, as much as we can be. Aside from protecting our own bodies when he hits, we tell him in simple terms and a stern tone, ""No, hitting is not okay, hitting hurts,"" and that's it. We then dont reward the behavior with anymore attention as long as he's not damaging anything/anybody.

We received advice to ignore the tantrums and just look or walk away and later praise him when he is showing good behavior. This has not shown noticeable improvement yet.

So...what do I do? Is this under the realm of normal toddler behavior, or is it going too far? Is he a sociopath? It feels like my daycare is saying he's the only toddler who ever does this stuff. I hate that he's hurting other kids, and I don't know what to do about ""working on it"" if I don't see it happening.

660,t3_54x2as,zaphne,"I know you're trying to be helpful by bringing this to my attention, but please trust me, I AM an expert in the field. I literally work with toddlers with autism every day. ASD kids are almost 70% of my caseload. I know what autism looks like. That said, since I know that some aggressive behaviors and things like hitting oneself are red flags, I have discussed the distinct possibility with many of my colleagues - pediatric ABA therapists, SLPs, PTs, OTs who work directly with the same population, AND had them informally evaluate him in person (which, honestly, we therapists secretly do with every kid we meet anyway) and the answer has been a resounding ""nope."" Autism can't be diagnosed by a few paragraphs on the internet about a set of behaviors that occur under one set of circumstances - the whole child must be considered and there are plenty of things about him that clearly point away from that diagnosis.

I am not delusional or closed off to the possibility - I've worked with too many parents like that. I'm very aware, and would be the first person to get a formal eval going should anything ever change in that direction.",1,"My 19 month old son has some temper issues.

667,t3_54x2as,,[removed],1,"My 19 month old son has some temper issues. 

Twice in the last 2 weeks, my daycare lady has pulled me aside to tell me that my son, who is the youngest of about 5 kids at daycare (max age almost 3) regularly hits, pushes, pulls at, and steals toys from all the other kids. He apparently pulled down a 2 yo boy the size of a 4 yo all the way to the ground and the kid hit his head on something. Not good.

They have been putting him on time-outs, 2-3 times a day. It has not done anything to change his behavior.

Most of the time when he takes a toy from someone and they catch him, they order him to give it back and he complies without issue. He then will usually grin and clap for himself for doing such a good thing. =/

Today, daycare lady said that he has stopped listening when they tell him to give stuff back or do anything. He is getting worse and throwing fits more and more when he gets scolded. Example she gave today: the kids were all drawing, he wanted to hold a bunch of markers at once, they told him only one at a time, he threw a maaaassive tantrum.

She wants us to be ""working on his behavior at home,"" but I'm not sure how. He is much better behaved at home. When we have playdates with other kids, he never hits them or steals their toys. And if he ever did, we would never just let him do it without discipline. (Note: we don't spank, and we have not yet done timeouts - I have doubts about their effectiveness at this age.)

Some things we HAVE seen at home that are troubling: as soon as we say the words ""no"" or ""don't"" or ""stop,"" even if it's not in a stern voice, he starts either crying (normal, I guess), hitting himself with his fist, banging his head on floor, wall, or crib, or dramatically throwing himself on the floor (also common?). Or a combination of those. He also says ""Ouch! Ouch!"" as he does the self-harming behavior. It is unclear whether it actually hurts him or that's all for show, but I think he mainly wants a reaction and attention. He has been hitting himself like that in frustration/protest since before he was a year old.

This does not mean we back off - we are firm and consistent, as much as we can be. Aside from protecting our own bodies when he hits, we tell him in simple terms and a stern tone, ""No, hitting is not okay, hitting hurts,"" and that's it.

Sadly I think all this is normal and will probably get worse before it gets better.",5,"My 16 month old has always been more interested in independent play than anything else, and more often than not he's perfectly content to play with this toy, then move on to that toy, and just do whatever he wants. 

At his 15 month check up, his pediatrician told us that right around now, its pretty typical for babies to really start testing limits and exerting control, usually by refusing food. We're a few days out from Leap 10, and one of the symptoms there is exploring their independence, specifically ""either they feed themselves or it ends of up the floor."" (Boy, is that the truth.)

In the past week or so, our little man who was content just do and play, now gets easily frustrated. My husband sent me a 5 minute video of him playing with a truck like normal, then screaming at it and throwing it on the floor, only to pick it back up and start rolling it along again. This, coupled with general tantrums and occasional banging his head on the floor when he doesn't get his way, got me to thinking. 

So... this is pretty normal behavior for this age, right? I'm not particularly worried, but he starts at daycare for the very first time on Thursday and I just need reassurance that they're not going to tell me after one day that I'm raising a little monster. "

How do you respond to this? I have found with all 3 of my kids that they tried this a couple of times. I completely and totally ignored them, and/or laughed. They each did it 2-3 times and when they go no reaction, they stopped.

By acquiescing to his demands you are reinforcing his bad behaviour. Right now you are rewarding his tantrums, you need to completely ignore them if at home, or in public take him out of the situation but don't give him what he wants.

694,t3_6276i6,missjay,Let him cry...within reason.,2,"If you check my post history, you'll see I've posted here about my son before, man oh man, this kid is a lot of work!

My 15 month old is insane. To a large degree, I've just accepted that he is a ""spirited"" child and it's just his personality, but I could still use some pointers from others who have been here.

He throws HUGE tantrums (like nothing my 3 year old has ever compared to).  Like fully splayed out on the ground, screaming his head off.  And he can keep it up for a LONG time.  He does this 20 times a day, no joke.  Whenever he can't get something he wants, he instantly throws a huge tantrum.  Sees the ceiling fan and wants to put his hands in it?  Can't?  Epic tantrum.  Repeat. He goes from smiling to screaming in the blink of an eye.

Often he flips out and ends up banging his head on something.  He just arches his back and throws himself. If he's in your arms when this happens it's hard not to drop him.  

He also hates being on the floor. He wants to be carried all of the time. I make dinner one handed, I pee with him clinging to my legs and crying, I tidy up by carting him around the house and reaching for things with one hand. My husband helps of course, but he does the same thing to him.  He weighs 26 pounds - so this isn't easy!  If we put him on the floor, he cries.  He's happy on the floor only if somebody is actively playing with him - so I'm pretty sure this isn't a pain/health thing.  

He also terrorizes his brother and our dog. He's extremely rough.  Right now we just take his hands and say ""gentle!"".  If he bites, which has happened a few times, we pick him up say ""no biting"" sternly, and put him down somewhere away from the action (which he HATES, que tantrum).

I'm generally of the mindset that you ""can't spoil a baby"", so until now we've been acquiescing to his dictator-like demands.  But I'm starting to feel like he's getting old enough to learn, and old enough that he is being spoiled by us always picking him up/rushing to get him to stop screaming.  So what do I do?  Just let him scream it out on the floor? 

If you don't have any advise, I'll also accept commiseration >_<

695,t3_6276i6,booradly,"Definitely ignore tantrum behavior usually they straighten up real quick once they know no one is paying attention to them, he will be fine. Wanting to be carried all the time is rough, chances are its just a re-enforced behavior sometimes you have to do what you have to do and put him down and let him cry, seems mean but that's what we had to do and now the problem is almost non-existent. Roughness comes with the age, just being consistent with the gentle and no biting, now would probably be a good time to introduce punishment if he doesn't listen. Mine did well with being explained why you don't handle roughly or bite, might be worth trying.

Don't worry this is a trying age for everyone it just takes patients and consistency, sounds like you got those down. Good luck!",2,"If you check my post history, you'll see I've posted here about my son before, man oh man, this kid is a lot of work!

696,t3_6276i6,pcbzelephant,The tantrums seem very normal. Maybe you were lucky with your other child not having them. Mines almost 2 and still throws massive tantrums about 10+ times a day but it is slowly getting better and they are getting shorter since she can talk more and understand a lot more. As for the biting and hitting mine did that for a few months around your sons age but stopped around 18 months. What I did was say oww that hurts you need to be nice. Or nice touch with the dogs. Hopefully if you keep that up he will stop in a bit. Good luck with the tantrums though they can be brutal. Now that mine can talk when she throws one she yells get away mom or I'm mad mom when I try to calm her... she's so dramatic! It's so embarrassing in public! I have tried everything to stop them too and usually ignoring them until she is calm works best but she will scream 5-10 mins+ and I never give into what she wants. Also mine used to love being held 24/7 too but at 18 months became way more independent and never wants to be held. She rather run off and do her own thing now. Anytime I hold her she yells down and wiggles out of my arms. So hopefully yours will grow out of it too.,1,"If you check my post history, you'll see I've posted here about my son before, man oh man, this kid is a lot of work!

I'm 25 and already starting to notice issues arising due to being overweight (heart palpitations, sore knees, starting to have trouble getting up off the floor etc). I feel like I'm failing my kid honestly. I don't want her be embarrassed of me. I want to be fit and healthy and able to participate in her life to the best of my ability. I also worry a lot about dying from obesity related issues and leaving her motherless. 

You'd think with all these fears, and with my daughter as motivation, I'd be able to get the weight off but it hasn't happened. I immediately hit a wall every time I try to change my unhealthy habits. I need to lose 60lbs to considered healthy again but personally I'd like to lose 90-100lbs. 



",7,"This question is inspired by a personal experience I had years ago. I was the 60lbs overweight dad of 2 children and husband of a fantastic woman. I ran up a long escalator on my way home to get home faster. I was only half-way up when I felt completely out of breath for an entire minute. My vision first went blurry, then I became dizzy and couldn't see anything for a while. I thought I was going to faint and fall backwards, banging my head so bad that I'd die on the spot. It was the first time in my life that the thought of dying became real. Images came flashing: I saw my own burial with my wife and kids at the grave, my kids graduating without me being there, my daughter being led to the altar by someone else. While I was recovering my breath, which felt like an eternity, I also reflected on how I was the only one to blame for this situation, because I was not taking care of my myself. I clearly understood that unless I wanted to die before seeing my children grow up I needed to start taking care of my health. 

I spent many nights lying in bed wrestling with this concern. I didn't even know where to begin to tackle the problem, because I was completely unprepared and uneducated about health/fitness/nutrition, and I was not in control of my eating habits. On a much deeper level I knew that these were not even the real reasons, but only excuses for not taking the first step for several weeks, and there were things much deeper inside of me, which held me back. I was concerned with what my wife, friends and relatives would think of me if I took a 180. Nobody in my immediate family was an inspiration and I thought I'd have to be just like them. I was worried of failing. I was worried of succeeding. I had no idea how I could integrate my personal fitness quest with family life. I thought I'd have to spend the afternoons in the gym instead of playing with the kids at home.

It's curious how as an otherwise completely balanced person I had all of these thoughts inside of me.

706,t3_6s3xt8,SheaRVA,"I struggle to keep my weight where I want it. I'm just on the cusp of a ""healthy"" BMI, but anyone with a brain knows that BMI is a joke measurement. So, my doc and I are working on that.

My parents have a heap of health issues in their genes and their lack of exercise and dietary choices aren't helping. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, overweight, my dad had his first heart attack in November and caused Type II diabetes because he didn't make enough changes when he was pre-diabetic.

Heart disease killed both of my paternal great-grand parents, my paternal grandmother has survived breast cancer 3 times and has severe osteoperosis. Both grandmothers are incredibly demented, one older and farther along, but neither are safe to live alone really.

So, that stuff is coming for me. A lot of it I can't control, but I can *influence*. I'm now a competitive kick boxer, as is my wife, so we're being proactive about staying healthy.

We stopped smoking together unless she was asleep and would do so around the end of the house so she couldn't see us. When she was three we decided we needed to quit.

She would hit me and scream and just play games with me it seemed to see how far she could go before I snapped on her then she would hurt herself, scream, cry, threaten to abort the baby, etc. She has another child who she has full custody of but she leaves at her aunts house (I've never met the kid I've only seen pictures) and she's about 4 months pregnant. She refuses to let me know anything about the baby and basically tells me it's her body and her rights and if I want to know anything I can take her to court and if I do that she'll press for child support and ruin me. She's recently cut off all contact with me and changed her number, claims what I'm doing is harassment when I speak to her, and she claims to have gotten married (which I don't believe but her ex is also crazy) She used to send semi threatening texts, like how me and her should meet up and when I denied meeting up with her (because she's abusive) she went on a rant on how she's just an incubator for me and how I don't care about her, also, following that she showed up at my work, started trying to hit me, then called the police and said I was stalking her as she sat in the parking lot (when she drove an hour to where I worked and waited for me to get off). I have texts of her abuse such as telling me how if I want to make her happy I need to kill myself, telling me how to tie a noose, threatening to take my dog into the woods and tie him to a tree and leave him there, a suicide note she wrote, dents on my door from her banging her head against it, messages of her threatening to cut my breaks and saying she was going to burn my apartment down, pictures of her cutting and a black eye she gave herself, messages of her telling me how she hopes I'm happy that I made her cut herself (because I wouldn't send a dick pic), and just basically her being a terrible person. She plays innocent to everyone else though and tries to convince them I'm lying and obsessed. Now my questions are: Is there anyway for me to actually be awarded full custody just based on these things? Is there anyway I can get proof the baby is mine before birth? Is there a way I can prevent her legally from doing something such as denying me the child, or just giving it up for adoption without consent? Is there anyway I can get something to inform me of when she goes into labor? Is there a way to get her committed somewhere or have a mental evaluation done? Is there a way to get someone else to make her not hurt herself or the baby? Also, just basic court advice would be helpful.

712,t3_6u41ga,,"Depending on the state when she says she's going to hurt herself that may be grounds for a psychiatric hold. Either way keep those texts and pics of her self-harming. Then if you take her to court you may be able to contest that she is not mentally stable to raise a child and file for custody. You can request a paternity test but I'm not sure there are any that are non-invasive before birth. I found an article talking about Non-Invasive Prenatal Paternity (NIPP) but it's pretty advanced technology so depending on your area the judge would probably order a test at birth. If it's court ordered she can't refuse.

713,t3_6u41ga,indigestible_wad,"I am actually very sorry you're going through this. My brother went through a very similar thing with his ex, and from an outsider's perspective it's heartbreaking to watch, let alone actually be the one who's going through and suffering like this.

My advice would be several:

* Document everything. Write down notes of your conversations. Document when she shows up to work. Take pictures. Ask friends, co-workers, family members, etc to write notes on what they saw. If your state allows single-party phone recordings, try to record phone calls. Save the voicemails and texts if she sends you anything.

* Find a family lawyer. Somebody who specializes in custody arrangements and parental rights. My brother has basically zero contact with his daughter and it's devastating and I wouldn't wish that on anybody. A good lawyer should be able to arrange at least partial custody or visitation at the very least, which is frankly better than nothing. They might also be able to file a paternity suit so you can prove that you're the father. This may vary by state.

* Don't be afraid to get help. My brother's ex drove my brother to a mental breakdown due to just the raw amount of sewage she was subjecting him to. Even if you don't think you need it, find a good counselor so you have somebody objective to talk to about the situation.

* Always do everything you can to remain in the child's life. Even if she's awarded custody, try to do everything legally in your power to remain present. My brother's ex has done this to several other guys in the past (she has 3 kids with all different fathers), some with not very good outcomes. 

My heart goes out to you. There's not much a random internet stranger can do except offer hugs and hope that it works out better for you than it did for my brother.

715,t3_6u41ga,the_onlyfox,"51-50 her ass seriously  (cop talk for mentally unhinged person) you have all the proff in the messages and thensome. She hurts herself while pregnant? That is grounds for putting her on suicide watch. You just need to call the non emergency number, say you are the father of the child and tell them what is going on. If they way proff well they can take a sample while the baby is still inside her but I don't recommend that at all because it can cause unnecessary stress to the baby plus she is already crazy. This isn't okay on her part she needs to be kept an eye on before she does serious harm to the child. After he/she is born take her to court for full custody and keep all records of her crazy shit.

724,t3_6u41ga,istara,"This absolutely sounds related. Just google ""cannabis psychosis"" - there are any amount of highly reputable sites describing what your situation sounds like.

I guess the issue is how long it will last, and if she'll ever get better.

I recommend you:

1. Get a lawyer so that's in place
2. Start documenting everything calmly
3. Do all you can to keep things civil. If seeing you or speaking with you makes her violent/irrational, don't see her/contact her except in the company of witnesses
3. If you can, communicate with her family (assuming they're reasonable people) and assure them that whatever happens with custody, you won't cut them out as grandparents. Because right now that may be a huge fear for them if she's ranting and raving, which means they'll absolutely pick her over you. But it may be if they're good people and equally worried about her, that you can band together to try and get her help

The best thing for this baby is two stable parents. The next best thing is one stable parent (and a hope that the other one will find stability one day).

Regarding custody: I think that if a mother wants to breastfeed, and is not judged as representing harm to the baby, it should be facilitated. Breastfeeding *is part of* the whole physiological process of pregnancy, so IF a woman wants to do that, she should be supported in doing so. Even if she's a total bitch, her body has still endured something for three months that yours has not, and I think - again, assuming no harm to the child - it should be her right to complete that process.",3,"So, I was dating a girl for about 10 months and managed to get her pregnant.

I have texts of her abuse such as telling me how if I want to make her happy I need to kill myself, telling me how to tie a noose, threatening to take my dog into the woods and tie him to a tree and leave him there, a suicide note she wrote, dents on my door from her banging her head against it, messages of her threatening to cut my breaks and saying she was going to burn my apartment down, pictures of her cutting and a black eye she gave herself, messages of her telling me how she hopes I'm happy that I made her cut herself (because I wouldn't send a dick pic), and just basically her being a terrible person. She plays innocent to everyone else though and tries to convince them I'm lying and obsessed. Now my questions are: Is there anyway for me to actually be awarded full custody just based on these things? Is there anyway I can get proof the baby is mine before birth? Is there a way I can prevent her legally from doing something such as denying me the child, or just giving it up for adoption without consent? Is there anyway I can get something to inform me of when she goes into labor? Is there a way to get her committed somewhere or have a mental evaluation done? Is there a way to get someone else to make her not hurt herself or the baby? Also, just basic court advice would be helpful. So far it seems like everything is against me, even when she showed up at my job and hit me the cops told me to leave her alone and go home and she got nothing."

731,t3_5cgylu,nowetbread,"Totally agree with the book recommendation.  Also, if you can catch it in time, response blocking for headbanging.  Have a small pillow handy for her to bang into.  You may want to try a Behavior  analyst to see if you can change the behavior.  I found that it wasn't so much about your child's behavior, but more about how you respond.  I would ensure safety and then ignore (sounds really simple, but probably one of the most difficult things I have ever done).  As far as the sensory stuff, you can ask for an Occupational therapy consult.   The OT should be able to help you out. ",9,"I need some insight - PLEASE! please.

732,t3_5cgylu,pixikins78,"You just described my daughter as a toddler, right down to the jealousy issues.  Between ages 2 and 4 I was convinced that she had autism or a spd.  My best friend who taught Spec Ed in an autistic classroom thought she had autism, but she didn't.

She is now 14, and while I don't have any advice to help you get through this rough time, I can offer some hope that it does get better.

My daughter's behavior improved dramatically when she started school.  I think that being away from me and not being babied helped.  Things got a little over-emotional between ages 9 and 11 (I blame hormones and the onset of puberty) but they've gradually improved up to now.

733,t3_5cgylu,athaliah,"Haha I was reading this and was like ""is this my husband's account? is he talking about our daughter?""

My daughter is the same way, except she won't hurt herself, but she will hit/hurt everything around her. She has been diagnosed with sensory processing disorder. When she has a meltdown, there is literally nothing to do but wait it out. We have her go to her room, not as punishment, but so she can get it out and cool down without bursting our ear drums or causing damage. She comes out on her own once she's calm. Basically, whatever is bothering her overwhelms her brain and sends it into flight or fight mode. It's not a behavior issue, she can't help it or stop it. When she has normal tantrums, they're definitely different...she's annoying and crying and whining over something she wants.  And in that scenario, it's generally considered a good idea to not provide positive reinforcement. So either way, there is no reason to lavish attention on them when they are freaking out. In a meltdown it does nothing, and in a tantrum it causes more problems.

I don't know if your daughter is having meltdowns or tantrums. You say if you ignore her, she gets worse, which sounds like a tantrum....you aren't giving her what she wants, so she ramps it up - which you then respond with attention and affection because you feel bad about it (what part of the tantrums do you find ethically wrong?). She knows she'll get your attention by freaking out, so why wouldn't she do it? Maybe there are multiple things at play here, IDK.",3,"I need some insight - PLEASE! please.

734,t3_5cgylu,lunapen,"My son is autistic but has similar intense meltdowns over control issues. It is a problem with self-regulation over change/transitions more so than sensory issues, imo, but I think the behavioral strategies apply to all kids. Whenever he had a meltdown, he used to immediately start hitting himself and this phase lasted on and off for about a year (18 mo - 2.5). It is incredibly disturbing to watch and I was terrified of serious injury so I can completely empathize with your distress here. 

This was how we were taught to respond by our behavioral therapist (who has a phd in child psych):

1. When your child starts to injure herself, wordlessly pick her up and place her somewhere safe - a bed, a bean bag, a thick rug, the couch. We still have a crib but anywhere is fine.  

2. Then, go away and do not respond! She is safe where she is. Do not talk because in this high moment of intense emotion, she cannot really process your words anyway and yes, that is still giving attention to behavior you want to go away. Any feedback here is going to reinforce that neural connection of ""oh, hit head? mom responds."" Do not make eye contact, do not talk, just ignore it.

3. If your daughter is as resilient as my son was, she might just jump off the bed and keep hurting herself on the hard kitchen floor. In that case, simply pick her back up onto the bed/etc and walk away. Do this as many times as you need to.

4. If you worry that your child will feel abandoned OR that walking away will result in more serious injury, you can stay in the room but continue to ignore it. I used to sit on the couch about a foot away from my son while he trashed around in tears. If he would stumble to me mid-meltdown, I would gently reseat him a foot away until he was calm enough to talk to. 

5. There is an emotional component of this for the parent. It was very hard for me to be a silent observer and I cursed our therapist at the time - it felt incredibly cruel. She also explained to me the general curve of behavioral change and discussed that bad behaviors get better...then get WAY WORSE...and then stop altogether. But if you are inconsistent, it just keeps amping up and up and up. She had preschoolers in helmets. But if you stick to the plan, you're doing this for her. Forms of self-injury get more and more deadly as children age so this is one way of short-circuiting that ""bad habit."" My son completely stopped hitting himself and it feels like an intense, bad nightmare from a long time ago.

Finally, there is a huge misunderstanding about the type of help you can get for kids. Even if your child is NOT on the autism spectrum, she can definitely see and benefit from Occupational Therapy and Behavioral Therapy. The autism diagnosis is mostly needed for insurance purposes. And also, preschool teachers aren't really qualified to diagnose for autism. If you are truly concerned about autism, take her to see a specialist like a developmental pediatrician or child psychologist. Girls on the spectrum present differently from boys and are under-diagnosed. ",2,"I need some insight - PLEASE! please. My daughter is 3 1/2 and has been spirited and very demanding since she was born. We just adapt to her needs, give her lots focused attention and positive reinforcement. We do not spank (and never will) and overall have gentle parenting style, but still have rules and boundaries and we don’t give her everything she wants (therein lies a power struggle currently). I stay at home with her and my 20 month old son (yes, there are very apparent jealousy issues). Right now, most of my days are spent working through prolonged meltdowns... by prolonged I mean anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and a half. Often we talk through them or if I am not available to sit with her and hold her hands and breathe, then she goes in her room to thrash around and just peter-out on her own. She has ALWAYS had some serious meltdowns, often hitting her face or back of her head on the floor. Recently, she is also hitting her legs and biting her fingers. We are realizing she only whines and fusses, tantrums around me or my husband. She goes to preschool 2 full days a week, and does just fine. Holds it in and usually loses it right after I pick her up. Just had a parent/teacher meeting and they are like, ‘Ya your kid is super sharp and right on point developmentally.’ They have zero concern about autism spectrum. She IS very smart, and I keep feeling like she’s totally working/manipulating me, but I also remain compassionate and try to see if from her perspective. She is just figuring out how things work, and cause and effect etc. I guarantee my husband and I are inadvertently reinforcing certain behavior, but I need to find something that is positive and gentle, because she just flat out won’t respond to the typical stern discipline techniques we have tried. And, ignoring her during a tantrum elevates the intensity, duration and results in self-harm and extreme distress and I do not want to do that anymore. I just can’t anymore…ethically. Fuck that. Yesterday it resulted in a giant bruised goose egg on her forehead after banging her head on the kitchen tile. No. Fuck no. 
I kind of suspect some sort of high functioning sensory processing sensitivity. She displays just a few of the indicators, but doesn’t fit in any label or box. She has a fear of the sound of a toilet flushing, she is very particular (cuff of sleeve needs to be rolled a certain way, socks and pants are not tight enough, tag hurts, brother is looking at her, blanket is not straight, etc.) She was never snugly as a baby, and often doesn't realize her own strength when playing and hugging etc. She has an extreme need for comfort (specifically from me) and recently it has intensified.

737,t3_5cgylu,,"Books are good for parents and relieving their anxiety, not for child rearing.  Sorry.  Also, your child isn't ""Sensitive"", at least not the way I interpret that.  Sensitive kids hyperfocus on their own emotional reaction to things and as a result tend to feel things much more intensely.   They tend to *Withdraw* in the face of emotion, not act it out.  Again, your mileage may vary.

No, I think Kiddo has an emotional regulation issue..the ability to modulate emotion.  That's a learned ability, and unfortunately, I think you've taught her the opposite, confusing your need to always be positive with responding positively to her awful, horrible behavior.  Oops.  You need her approval entirely too much.

When she acts out..or preferably when you see her winding up..make that observation and try in the moment to get her to calm down.  If she cannot, send her to her room or otherwise ignore her...after explaining to her what you are doing and why..and leave it alone.

Holding her or otherwise attending to her at those times simply gratifies the behavior, making it far more likely to be repeated.  What you want is to *Stop* the behavior, and to do so, you need to 1) appeal to reason first, and then 2) appeal to the need for attention and approval.  Right now, you're doing neither and actually encouraging the behavior.

You have to be flexible enough in your approach to realize that allowing bad behavioral patterns does  any one any good, and intervening and making her upset isn't ""harsh"", but in both the short and long term, beneficial. So, some of the work here is an attitude readjustment on your part, too.",-2,"I need some insight - PLEASE! please. My daughter is 3 1/2 and has been spirited and very demanding since she was born.

741,t3_5cgylu,Iron_Ptarmigan,"I knew there were other parents with similar experiences, thank you for sharing yours. We call it quiet time, and she'll scream in there for a good while, and then calm down and play quietly and then emerge only to lose it over something else a short while later. She has a mixture of tantrums and meltdowns, and there is definitely a difference. Tantrums we can reason through and in the past couple days I have been using Neuro-Linguistic Programming for toddlers, and it seems to be somewhat effective for oppositional behavior. I have a whole series of audio lessons that I'm hopeful about. Meltdowns are massively impulsive and explosive and talking is futile. Tantrums can turn ugly when I ignore them and stand firm. I intervene when she starts harming herself or her brother. I try to save the attention and comfort for after she has calmed down, but if the situation allows, I do with calming exercises to help her through the uproar...and they work, but I don't always have the freedom to apply it. I know we are going awry somewhere and I'm certain it lies lack of consistency and structure, and that's why I'm looking for ideas. 
I find Ignoring her when she is seriously injuring herself (or her brother, as he is sometimes the closest object to unleash on) is a technique I can't support. 
I do appreciate the recommendation to have a pillow handy for her to bang on, but we tried that and everything in the vicinity of her flailing arms and legs is snowangeled to the wayside.

744,t3_5cgylu,nowetbread,"""The Out if Sync Child"" does not make the parent feel better at all.  It is about children with sensory integration issues.  The OP has expressed that she feels her child has some sensory issues.  Headbanging is not uncommon and may fulfill the need for sensory input.   The OP would probably benefit from taking her child for an assessment with an OT.  Reading up on sensory integration disorders is beneficial to increase your knowledge going in.  

Not everything in the world can be changed by the way you parent, some issues need outside help.  In this case ignoring the specific behavior may end it.  However, it may not decrease the need for the sensory stimulation.  She may need a replacement behavior that satisfies the need without being harmful.  ",10,"I need some insight - PLEASE! please.

746,t3_5cgylu,Iron_Ptarmigan,"Thank you. Is this also from your experience? Were you able to apply these techniques with successful outcome? I'm eager to know. From my understanding, as I have been delving into possible explanations, emotional regulation and sensory processing disorders are directly related. Sensitive children can be over-responsive (outbursts), under-responsive (withdraw) or sensory seeking (apparent numbness to pain). My ability to spend time on the computer without interruption is a luxury, so my post was made in a bit of desperation and may have a lot of disconnect. I will also say that there is another variable in the equation, and that is my son, who displays none of the attributes that my daughter has. So, I recognize that I may be approaching her behavior in a counterproductive way, which is why I am here! However, I don't think the situation is as black and white as you interpret. Normally, I work to calm her in the moment if there IS a wind-up period. Often, she instantly goes straight to the point no return at the drop of a hat, i.e. rigid body, eyes rolling back in her head and any amount of reasoning is futile. My go-to, especially on days I am utterly exhausted, I usually take her to her room, explain why and close the door. That gives me a moment, too. I only stay to help her through it if my son doesn't get upset by her behavior, if she doesn't hit him or yell at him, or if she doesn't freak out because he is simply there with us...there's the jealousy aspect. What does work to calm her down is if I am there to sit with her, hold her hands and breathe with her, and my son can chill and play with toys. In those moments, I see there is gratification or encouragement of behavior, but it's not consistent. Holding her is always what she wants, but something she rarely gets because I'm either holding her brother or I'm not willing to do it because she wants it in a very specific way and she just gets even more upset. The times she is in a good mood is my opportunity to hold her, give her positive reinforcement or do activities and projects.",1,"I need some insight - PLEASE! please.

754,t3_5cgylu,pixikins78,"Mine got much worse at 2, but she was a challenge since birth.  As an infant, I was the only one who could hold her or comfort her and the minute I laid her down she would scream her head off.  Nursing was the only way to quiet her.  She wouldn't take a pacifier or bottle and we tried every nipple on the market at the time.  I even bought a bottle that was nearly all nipple and shaped like a breast, no go.  

I had to learn how to pick up toys and do cleaning and laundry with one hand (and sometimes my feet and toes!) because she had to be held all of the time.

She also hated the car seat, and at under a year old, she would stiffen her body like a board so that I couldn't buckle her in without forceably bending her, and then she would scream through the entire car trip.

If it was a ""phase,"" it was one that lasted for the first four years of her life.

I definitely think you should have her evaluated (we did) but if you don't get any answers from that (we didn't) there is hope that she might change as she grows and matures.",1,"I need some insight - PLEASE! please.

759,t3_5cgylu,,"The limitations of the internet make accurate assessment difficult.  It's not about liking a hug and a kiss..that's a purely emotional (and sentimental) response.   It's about effective intervention that addresses the source of the problem.
A 2 hour melt down *IS* a real problem and is indicative of some underlying disturbance, be it with self soothing or emotional modulation or self control *which requires more than a superficial response to the child's emotional state*.  Merely hugging them doesn't teach them the skills required to exert some self control.   The OP can (and should) be sensitive to the child's obvious emotional distress (and clearly indicate that), without indulging it.

760,t3_5cgylu,pixikins78,"Yep.  That sounds so familiar.  I really don't miss those days.

On one particularly difficult day my oldest son was in first grade and was invited to a birthday roller skating party about 30 minutes from home.  While I was wrapping the gift and getting him ready, my daughter got into my makeup and completely covered one half of her face with blush.  She was very thorough, it was in and behind her ear, her nostrils, her eye, etc.  She also had very sensitive skin, so when I washed the makeup off, her skin was all blotchy and red.  

We did the car seat meltdown thing and by the time we got to the skating rink, she had been screaming for 30 minutes and her face looked like she had been badly beaten. 

My son went to a very small private Christian school, so you can imagine the looks that I got.

One very nice older mom (she had a son and daughter in high school and her youngest was the same age as my oldest) pulled me aside and without an explanation from me, she said, ""It gets better, I promise.""  Then she told me all about her daughter who was much like mine as a young child, but was now thriving in high school and a joy to parent as a young teenager.  Her words didn't fix my current situation, but they gave me a little bit of hope.

It does get better, I promise.  :)",2,"I need some insight - PLEASE! please. My daughter is 3 1/2 and has been spirited and very demanding since she was born.

My son has always been a head-bumper. We put wonder bumpers on the slatted sides, but didn't do anything on the ends. Even at 2.5 he still bangs his head on them regularly, stirs, then goes back to sleep.

My son's mother and I split up when he was 2 due to a series of poor decisions on her part. She raised him through kindergarten and I took full custody just before first grade. We were working with a lawyer, building a case to take full custody when her health deteriorated badly and she couldn't raise him, so it turned out unneeded because she gave up custody due to her medical condition.

When I took custody of my son I was already living with my now fiancé, so there has been a stable adult presence in his life consistently. We've moved a few times, but our household has remained stable. His mother and her boyfriend whom she lives in live a rather immature lifestyle and think it's funny when my son lies for them, acts out in obscene or lewd ways, or is otherwise gross.

When I took full custody of my son was when I realized exactly how bad things were. In school he would completely lose his mind, multiple times a day, throwing massive temper tantrums. This was always when he was put in positions he needed to do things he didn't want. His go to excuse for years was that he ""missed his mom"". She ate this up and encouraged this behavior because she felt like it proved he loved her.

Over the years we have gone through therapists, individually and as a family, even including my ex in some of the family therapy.

We have tried being heavy handed and hard on him with consequences and punishments...

Now, we've seen improvement. Just not enough. He is now getting old enough and his mother has checked out of his life in large part, that he no longer bases his behavior on his mother's whim. Also, he has proven that in small doses he can control himself. At home he is kind and respectful to me and my fiancé, and any other authority figures. He behaves with his friends and other kids who might be around us. In large part, he doesn't push us at all and acts perfectly normal/right. So we no longer can ever catch him in the act to help solve these issues. The other issue compounding this is that he lies. He lies about anything and everything that he could even remotely be given negative consequences for, even though he knows lying will make things much worse.

This brings us to last year. With him being fairly well behaved at home and improvements over time, we set him up with a sports program that is academic and behavior based, with a score chart and means of earning points to be able to play in his weekly games. Last year was also the first time he has been involved in sports. Having seen how well he is doing in team sports, that he has really contributed and bought into the systems, and that the heavy handed football coaches really reigned in his attitude, we thought things were going well. We had a few bumps in the road, but had an excellent teacher and staff at his school, and saw everything getting much better until the last month or so of school, which was very rough. We chalked it up to a rough patch in what was otherwise his best year.

Summer he spent a few weeks at his mother's home.

With school now about 3 months in we are about to lose our minds. He just started middle school, so 7 classes per day. We thought this might actually help at first, as he doesn't have time to really get distracted or off task with each class being short. The opposite is the case. We were aware of his struggles, but here is what his grades look like after the first report card.

What's worse, is that there is a direct correlation between his attitude and his grades. We have had MANY discussions with staff at the school, sit downs, one on ones, and more phone calls than I can remember with different staff members, mostly with his Science teacher and Language arts teacher or the principle / vice principle.

He is being very disrespectful to teachers, staff, other kids, etc. Saying very mean things, or just responding with a bad attitude. Often times slamming items, throwing them, and when corrected sometimes ending up screaming at people and having to be escorted out of class. In large part, he has missed about half his classes in Science this year because he gets kicked out of the Language arts class, sent to the office, and they keep him there until the end of the day. When he is missing most of his classes, his grade plummets. He's a smart kid when he applies himself, but lets his attitude and anger just boil up, over seemingly nothing. His fuse in these classes is so short, staff and children both don't know how to act around him and it has alienated him from the bulk of his peers at school too.

We have a routine of how we handle his outbursts now, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in it. We have a heavy reward system for making right choices, and a heavy consequence system for making wrong choices. It seems like physical activity and physical chores can sometimes set him straight for a few days or a week (we do up-down exercises outside while discussing the problem if it's happened more than twice, rain or shine, as he hates that particular exercise and he wants to avoid it when possible). The problem is, we run into the same problem again in a week, or even a few days.

This sucks. I want my kid to have friends, be friendly and do well in school. I don't want to have to be the bad guy all the time, but I feel like that's my life. I rarely get to do fun things with my son because he is always in trouble. I am dreading leaving work in an hour because I just got another call from his science teacher that he had a meltdown today.

I'm not sure what advice can even be given, or if I'm just a frustrated parent who needs to vent. The real issues I have now are that there is a very real possibility that he won't get through the year, and we'll be looking at expulsion. It was very lightly brought up at the last sit down we had, and things aren't improving. It doesn't seem that medication (he was on adderal for a while), therapy (again multiple types), rewards or consequences even matter to him.

We've also ran into him banging his head on things, saying he was a terrible kid and shouldn't be alive....... It's heartbreaking when he gets like this... Those have been isolated and rare incidences, and might be attention grabs he learned from his mom, but he is too young for that stuff. Therapists talk about revelations and success in conquering problems with him, but they don't change any of his behavior.

Have any of you experienced anything similar? How'd it work out? What did you do? It affects my relationship with my son and my relationship with my fiancé poorly. I dread having to go home and tackle these issues every day, and spend the late afternoon waiting for a crappy email or phone call from school."
774,t3_3uxxeh,Arms_Akimbo,"My kid's first year of middle school was a horror story.  I think that's true of everyone.  The social navigation required of middle school kids is really, really hard.  I wouldn't worry too much about grades at this point.

It sounds like your kid had a pretty chaotic early childhood and that sucks but here's a hard truth:  you have got to get past that, quit blaming the past and other people, and forge ahead.

I adopted my kid when he was six.  He had a shit storm life before he came to live with us.  For a long time I pointed to his past as the reason we were having problems with the present.  And it was true -- that crap had a huge impact.  It wasn't until I realized that I couldn't change those things that had happened and that I had to find ways to work around them to help him find a way to live happily that things got better for all of us.

Moving a few times might feel stable to you -- I guarantee you that it didn't feel stable to him.

I think both rewards and punishment are bullshit.  Neither worked with my kid.  He knew it was nothing but manipulation -- and he was right.  The only thing that worked for us was serious, honest discussions about the possible outcomes of the decisions, both good and bad, that he was making.

Anyway... this post is kind of a mess.  It's been a long day and I'm sure some of it will be misinterpreted but I think I got the basics down.  It isn't a popular way of looking at things.

Middle school, the entirety of it, kind of sucks.  Make your home a haven for your kid where he can leave that stuff behind.

My ex also lies, cheats, steals and fucks over other people for her own benefit and when called out on any of this, completely loses her mind and acts like an irrational crazy person and has even resorted to self harm or attempted suicide for big, showy attention grabs (this is relevant later).

When I took full custody of my son was when I realized exactly how bad things were. In school he would completely lose his mind, multiple times a day, throwing massive temper tantrums. This was always when he was put in positions he needed to do things he didn't want. His go to excuse for years was that he ""missed his mom"". She ate this up and encouraged this behavior because she felt like it proved he loved her.

Over the years we have gone through therapists, individually and as a family, even including my ex in some of the family therapy. We have encouraged him, found friends with kids, tried to get him involved in giving back and charity... We have tried to be soft handed, working with him through issues and never getting upset... We have tried being heavy handed and hard on him with consequences and punishments...

Now, we've seen improvement. Just not enough. He is now getting old enough and his mother has checked out of his life in large part, that he no longer bases his behavior on his mother's whim. Also, he has proven that in small doses he can control himself. At home he is kind and respectful to me and my fiancé, and any other authority figures. He behaves with his friends and other kids who might be around us. In large part, he doesn't push us at all and acts perfectly normal/right. So we no longer can ever catch him in the act to help solve these issues. The other issue compounding this is that he lies. He lies about anything and everything that he could even remotely be given negative consequences for, even though he knows lying will make things much worse.

This brings us to last year. With him being fairly well behaved at home and improvements over time, we set him up with a sports program that is academic and behavior based, with a score chart and means of earning points to be able to play in his weekly games. Last year was also the first time he has been involved in sports. Having seen how well he is doing in team sports, that he has really contributed and bought into the systems, and that the heavy handed football coaches really reigned in his attitude, we thought things were going well. We had a few bumps in the road, but had an excellent teacher and staff at his school, and saw everything getting much better until the last month or so of school, which was very rough. We chalked it up to a rough patch in what was otherwise his best year.

Summer he spent a few weeks at his mother's home.

With school now about 3 months in we are about to lose our minds. He just started middle school, so 7 classes per day. We thought this might actually help at first, as he doesn't have time to really get distracted or off task with each class being short. The opposite is the case. We were aware of his struggles, but here is what his grades look like after the first report card.

What's worse, is that there is a direct correlation between his attitude and his grades. We have had MANY discussions with staff at the school, sit downs, one on ones, and more phone calls than I can remember with different staff members, mostly with his Science teacher and Language arts teacher or the principle / vice principle.

He is being very disrespectful to teachers, staff, other kids, etc. Saying very mean things, or just responding with a bad attitude. Often times slamming items, throwing them, and when corrected sometimes ending up screaming at people and having to be escorted out of class. In large part, he has missed about half his classes in Science this year because he gets kicked out of the Language arts class, sent to the office, and they keep him there until the end of the day. When he is missing most of his classes, his grade plummets. He's a smart kid when he applies himself, but lets his attitude and anger just boil up, over seemingly nothing. His fuse in these classes is so short, staff and children both don't know how to act around him and it has alienated him from the bulk of his peers at school too.

We have a routine of how we handle his outbursts now, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in it. We have a heavy reward system for making right choices, and a heavy consequence system for making wrong choices. It seems like physical activity and physical chores can sometimes set him straight for a few days or a week (we do up-down exercises outside while discussing the problem if it's happened more than twice, rain or shine, as he hates that particular exercise and he wants to avoid it when possible). The problem is, we run into the same problem again in a week, or even a few days.

This sucks. I want my kid to have friends, be friendly and do well in school. I don't want to have to be the bad guy all the time, but I feel like that's my life. I rarely get to do fun things with my son because he is always in trouble. I am dreading leaving work in an hour because I just got another call from his science teacher that he had a meltdown today.

I'm not sure what advice can even be given, or if I'm just a frustrated parent who needs to vent. The real issues I have now are that there is a very real possibility that he won't get through the year, and we'll be looking at expulsion. It was very lightly brought up at the last sit down we had, and things aren't improving. It doesn't seem that medication (he was on adderal for a while), therapy (again multiple types), rewards or consequences even matter to him.

We've also ran into him banging his head on things, saying he was a terrible kid and shouldn't be alive....... It's heartbreaking when he gets like this... Those have been isolated and rare incidences, and might be attention grabs he learned from his mom, but he is too young for that stuff. Therapists talk about revelations and success in conquering problems with him, but they don't change any of his behavior.

Have any of you experienced anything similar? How'd it work out? What did you do? It affects my relationship with my son and my relationship with my fiancé poorly. I dread having to go home and tackle these issues every day, and spend the late afternoon waiting for a crappy email or phone call from school."

778,t3_3uxxeh,jbt2003,"This situation reminds me very much of a family of students I had early in my teaching career. There were four girls, aged 14 to 4, and they were basically being raised by their father. Their mother was a complete basket case, doing drugs, dating abusive men (who also abused the girls), and so on. At one point, when the oldest girl was a senior high school, their mom was put in jail. 

The kids were girls, so their reaction to this situation tended to be less about acting out (the way boys tend to do), and more about shutting down. 

I know this isn't an option for most people, but I wonder if you should start looking into another school. Depending on where you live, there's highly likely to be a smaller school nearby, where the teacher / student relationship is less about compliance and more about cooperation. It seems like if your son had adults in his life who actually knew him as a person (as opposed to as a behavior problem) this could help. It could also help if he was in a school where the approach to outbursts isn't piling on negative consequences but rather working with the child to learn better responses to negative emotions.

With school now about 3 months in we are about to lose our minds. He just started middle school, so 7 classes per day. We thought this might actually help at first, as he doesn't have time to really get distracted or off task with each class being short. The opposite is the case. We were aware of his struggles, but here is what his grades look like after the first report card.

What's worse, is that there is a direct correlation between his attitude and his grades. We have had MANY discussions with staff at the school, sit downs, one on ones, and more phone calls than I can remember with different staff members, mostly with his Science teacher and Language arts teacher or the principle / vice principle.

He is being very disrespectful to teachers, staff, other kids, etc. Saying very mean things, or just responding with a bad attitude. Often times slamming items, throwing them, and when corrected sometimes ending up screaming at people and having to be escorted out of class. In large part, he has missed about half his classes in Science this year because he gets kicked out of the Language arts class, sent to the office, and they keep him there until the end of the day. When he is missing most of his classes, his grade plummets. He's a smart kid when he applies himself, but lets his attitude and anger just boil up, over seemingly nothing. His fuse in these classes is so short, staff and children both don't know how to act around him and it has alienated him from the bulk of his peers at school too.

We have a routine of how we handle his outbursts now, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in it. We have a heavy reward system for making right choices, and a heavy consequence system for making wrong choices. It seems like physical activity and physical chores can sometimes set him straight for a few days or a week (we do up-down exercises outside while discussing the problem if it's happened more than twice, rain or shine, as he hates that particular exercise and he wants to avoid it when possible). The problem is, we run into the same problem again in a week, or even a few days.

This sucks. I want my kid to have friends, be friendly and do well in school. I don't want to have to be the bad guy all the time, but I feel like that's my life. I rarely get to do fun things with my son because he is always in trouble. I am dreading leaving work in an hour because I just got another call from his science teacher that he had a meltdown today.

I'm not sure what advice can even be given, or if I'm just a frustrated parent who needs to vent. The real issues I have now are that there is a very real possibility that he won't get through the year, and we'll be looking at expulsion. It was very lightly brought up at the last sit down we had, and things aren't improving. It doesn't seem that medication (he was on adderal for a while), therapy (again multiple types), rewards or consequences even matter to him.

We've also ran into him banging his head on things, saying he was a terrible kid and shouldn't be alive....... It's heartbreaking when he gets like this... Those have been isolated and rare incidences, and might be attention grabs he learned from his mom, but he is too young for that stuff. Therapists talk about revelations and success in conquering problems with him, but they don't change any of his behavior.

Have any of you experienced anything similar? How'd it work out? What did you do? It affects my relationship with my son and my relationship with my fiancé poorly. I dread having to go home and tackle these issues every day, and spend the late afternoon waiting for a crappy email or phone call from school."
781,t3_3uxxeh,SweetScentofEarwax,"Something has to be setting him off. Do you think he knows how to bring himself down when he feels his rage building up? It sounds like that wasn't modeled for him when he was younger. Talk with him about how it actually feels at the very beginning of feeling pissed off, and come up with ways to gain control--like breathing exercises or a 'mantra' that will bring him back to reality. Reminding my daughter to 'smell the roses, then blow out the birthday candles' is helping her when she's overwhelmed and about to snap. I applaud your patients!",1,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back. We want him to grow up happy and socially adjusted but nothing has worked. I suppose a bit of background is in order too.

My son's mother and I split up when he was 2 due to a series of poor decisions on her part. She raised him through kindergarten and I took full custody just before first grade. We were working with a lawyer, building a case to take full custody when her health deteriorated badly and she couldn't raise him, so it turned out unneeded because she gave up custody due to her medical condition.

When I took custody of my son I was already living with my now fiancé, so there has been a stable adult presence in his life consistently. We've moved a few times, but our household has remained stable. His mother and her boyfriend whom she lives in live a rather immature lifestyle and think it's funny when my son lies for them, acts out in obscene or lewd ways, or is otherwise gross. My ex also lies, cheats, steals and fucks over other people for her own benefit and when called out on any of this, completely loses her mind and acts like an irrational crazy person and has even resorted to self harm or attempted suicide for big, showy attention grabs (this is relevant later).

When I took full custody of my son was when I realized exactly how bad things were. In school he would completely lose his mind, multiple times a day, throwing massive temper tantrums. This was always when he was put in positions he needed to do things he didn't want. His go to excuse for years was that he ""missed his mom"". She ate this up and encouraged this behavior because she felt like it proved he loved her.

Over the years we have gone through therapists, individually and as a family, even including my ex in some of the family therapy. We have encouraged him, found friends with kids, tried to get him involved in giving back and charity... We have tried to be soft handed, working with him through issues and never getting upset... We have tried being heavy handed and hard on him with consequences and punishments...

Now, we've seen improvement. Just not enough. He is now getting old enough and his mother has checked out of his life in large part, that he no longer bases his behavior on his mother's whim. Also, he has proven that in small doses he can control himself. At home he is kind and respectful to me and my fiancé, and any other authority figures. He behaves with his friends and other kids who might be around us. In large part, he doesn't push us at all and acts perfectly normal/right. So we no longer can ever catch him in the act to help solve these issues. The other issue compounding this is that he lies. He lies about anything and everything that he could even remotely be given negative consequences for, even though he knows lying will make things much worse.

This brings us to last year. With him being fairly well behaved at home and improvements over time, we set him up with a sports program that is academic and behavior based, with a score chart and means of earning points to be able to play in his weekly games. Last year was also the first time he has been involved in sports. Having seen how well he is doing in team sports, that he has really contributed and bought into the systems, and that the heavy handed football coaches really reigned in his attitude, we thought things were going well. We had a few bumps in the road, but had an excellent teacher and staff at his school, and saw everything getting much better until the last month or so of school, which was very rough.

782,t3_3uxxeh,EBofEB,"Wow, with head banging especially he could be reacting to something he eats.  I started /r/fooddyefree and there is a link on head banging there.  You should also  look into the Feingold  diet.  Are science  and language arts at the same time  every day and if so, at what times?

783,t3_3uxxeh,ChaosShifter,"I think it is a combination of those things, plus his personal enjoyment in the classes. He loves engineering (think shop class) and Band (third year percussion). He has found a fondness the last year for reading too (in large part due to being often grounded from other activities). 

I also think that it being later in the day is rough too. We have discussed with the principles and teachers of rearranging classes, but the electives he thrives in are all full in the later part of the day. We are still exploring this.

Language Arts, Math and Science all have a kid in them that my son doesn't get along with well too. They compete for the attention of a mutual friend, whom prefers the other kid over my son. This isn't to say that my son isn't liked by the third party, but the lack of preferential treatment causes my son a lot of anxiety and jealousy. That said, the mutual friend isn't even in those classes, and the two kids have been seated away from another and is a thing we are trying to address.

The school is currently evaluating options for changing schedules and trying to help, but it is excruciatingly slow with no sure solution in sight.

784,t3_3uxxeh,ChaosShifter,"Hey, I appreciate the comment and I mostly agree. The fear is really in him potentially getting kicked out of school. This is the bigger concern.

As far as the moves, all of them were within about 2 miles of each other until last year. He maintained the same school and friends. A year ago July we moved to the next state over (about 300 miles away) and had a rather fantastic year considering. 

We try to have an open door policy regarding discussions. We also do our best to talk through problems first. Creating as much of a good atmosphere as possible.

All that said, I am in agreement with middle school sucking. I feel bad for him though. I don't know how to help him. It hurts his grades, sure. Although I am much more concerned with his relationships with his peers.

We have a routine of how we handle his outbursts now, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in it. We have a heavy reward system for making right choices, and a heavy consequence system for making wrong choices. It seems like physical activity and physical chores can sometimes set him straight for a few days or a week (we do up-down exercises outside while discussing the problem if it's happened more than twice, rain or shine, as he hates that particular exercise and he wants to avoid it when possible). The problem is, we run into the same problem again in a week, or even a few days.

This sucks. I want my kid to have friends, be friendly and do well in school. I don't want to have to be the bad guy all the time, but I feel like that's my life. I rarely get to do fun things with my son because he is always in trouble. I am dreading leaving work in an hour because I just got another call from his science teacher that he had a meltdown today.

I'm not sure what advice can even be given, or if I'm just a frustrated parent who needs to vent. The real issues I have now are that there is a very real possibility that he won't get through the year, and we'll be looking at expulsion. It was very lightly brought up at the last sit down we had, and things aren't improving. It doesn't seem that medication (he was on adderal for a while), therapy (again multiple types), rewards or consequences even matter to him.

We've also ran into him banging his head on things, saying he was a terrible kid and shouldn't be alive....... It's heartbreaking when he gets like this... Those have been isolated and rare incidences, and might be attention grabs he learned from his mom, but he is too young for that stuff. Therapists talk about revelations and success in conquering problems with him, but they don't change any of his behavior.

Have any of you experienced anything similar? How'd it work out? What did you do? It affects my relationship with my son and my relationship with my fiancé poorly. I dread having to go home and tackle these issues every day, and spend the late afternoon waiting for a crappy email or phone call from school."
785,t3_3uxxeh,ChaosShifter,"I can see where this could be inferred, as it is what I wrote. Although it was more a point of personal perspective. We still do enjoyable things together, but my personal fun has been sapped out of them due to the impending dread of what comes next.

Yesterday my son and I had a day alone together. We watched a movie, went on a walk to the nearby mall and had ice cream while talking about how things are going. Only for there to be another big problem in school today. I find it hard to enjoy these times personally when I feel like it's insincere on his end and not worth earning more privilidges or just acting with common decency at school.",6,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back. We want him to grow up happy and socially adjusted but nothing has worked. I suppose a bit of background is in order too.

My son's mother and I split up when he was 2 due to a series of poor decisions on her part. She raised him through kindergarten and I took full custody just before first grade. We were working with a lawyer, building a case to take full custody when her health deteriorated badly and she couldn't raise him, so it turned out unneeded because she gave up custody due to her medical condition.

When I took custody of my son I was already living with my now fiancé, so there has been a stable adult presence in his life consistently. We've moved a few times, but our household has remained stable. His mother and her boyfriend whom she lives in live a rather immature lifestyle and think it's funny when my son lies for them, acts out in obscene or lewd ways, or is otherwise gross. My ex also lies, cheats, steals and fucks over other people for her own benefit and when called out on any of this, completely loses her mind and acts like an irrational crazy person and has even resorted to self harm or attempted suicide for big, showy attention grabs (this is relevant later).

When I took full custody of my son was when I realized exactly how bad things were. In school he would completely lose his mind, multiple times a day, throwing massive temper tantrums. This was always when he was put in positions he needed to do things he didn't want. His go to excuse for years was that he ""missed his mom"". She ate this up and encouraged this behavior because she felt like it proved he loved her.

Over the years we have gone through therapists, individually and as a family, even including my ex in some of the family therapy. We have encouraged him, found friends with kids, tried to get him involved in giving back and charity... We have tried to be soft handed, working with him through issues and never getting upset... We have tried being heavy handed and hard on him with consequences and punishments...

Now, we've seen improvement. Just not enough. He is now getting old enough and his mother has checked out of his life in large part, that he no longer bases his behavior on his mother's whim. Also, he has proven that in small doses he can control himself. At home he is kind and respectful to me and my fiancé, and any other authority figures. He behaves with his friends and other kids who might be around us. In large part, he doesn't push us at all and acts perfectly normal/right. So we no longer can ever catch him in the act to help solve these issues. The other issue compounding this is that he lies. He lies about anything and everything that he could even remotely be given negative consequences for, even though he knows lying will make things much worse.

This brings us to last year. With him being fairly well behaved at home and improvements over time, we set him up with a sports program that is academic and behavior based, with a score chart and means of earning points to be able to play in his weekly games. Last year was also the first time he has been involved in sports. Having seen how well he is doing in team sports, that he has really contributed and bought into the systems, and that the heavy handed football coaches really reigned in his attitude, we thought things were going well. We had a few bumps in the road, but had an excellent teacher and staff at his school, and saw everything getting much better until the last month or so of school, which was very rough. We chalked it up to a rough patch in what was otherwise his best year.

Summer he spent a few weeks at his mother's home.

With school now about 3 months in we are about to lose our minds. He just started middle school, so 7 classes per day. We thought this might actually help at first, as he doesn't have time to really get distracted or off task with each class being short. The opposite is the case. We were aware of his struggles, but here is what his grades look like after the first report card.

What's worse, is that there is a direct correlation between his attitude and his grades. We have had MANY discussions with staff at the school, sit downs, one on ones, and more phone calls than I can remember with different staff members, mostly with his Science teacher and Language arts teacher or the principle / vice principle.

He is being very disrespectful to teachers, staff, other kids, etc. Saying very mean things, or just responding with a bad attitude. Often times slamming items, throwing them, and when corrected sometimes ending up screaming at people and having to be escorted out of class. In large part, he has missed about half his classes in Science this year because he gets kicked out of the Language arts class, sent to the office, and they keep him there until the end of the day.

Ridiculous. ,3,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back. We want him to grow up happy and socially adjusted but nothing has worked. I suppose a bit of background is in order too.

My son's mother and I split up when he was 2 due to a series of poor decisions on her part. She raised him through kindergarten and I took full custody just before first grade. We were working with a lawyer, building a case to take full custody when her health deteriorated badly and she couldn't raise him, so it turned out unneeded because she gave up custody due to her medical condition.

When I took custody of my son I was already living with my now fiancé, so there has been a stable adult presence in his life consistently. We've moved a few times, but our household has remained stable. His mother and her boyfriend whom she lives in live a rather immature lifestyle and think it's funny when my son lies for them, acts out in obscene or lewd ways, or is otherwise gross. My ex also lies, cheats, steals and fucks over other people for her own benefit and when called out on any of this, completely loses her mind and acts like an irrational crazy person and has even resorted to self harm or attempted suicide for big, showy attention grabs (this is relevant later).

When I took full custody of my son was when I realized exactly how bad things were. In school he would completely lose his mind, multiple times a day, throwing massive temper tantrums. This was always when he was put in positions he needed to do things he didn't want. His go to excuse for years was that he ""missed his mom"". She ate this up and encouraged this behavior because she felt like it proved he loved her.

Over the years we have gone through therapists, individually and as a family, even including my ex in some of the family therapy. We have encouraged him, found friends with kids, tried to get him involved in giving back and charity... We have tried to be soft handed, working with him through issues and never getting upset... We have tried being heavy handed and hard on him with consequences and punishments...

Now, we've seen improvement. Just not enough. He is now getting old enough and his mother has checked out of his life in large part, that he no longer bases his behavior on his mother's whim. Also, he has proven that in small doses he can control himself. At home he is kind and respectful to me and my fiancé, and any other authority figures. He behaves with his friends and other kids who might be around us. In large part, he doesn't push us at all and acts perfectly normal/right. So we no longer can ever catch him in the act to help solve these issues. The other issue compounding this is that he lies. He lies about anything and everything that he could even remotely be given negative consequences for, even though he knows lying will make things much worse.

This brings us to last year. With him being fairly well behaved at home and improvements over time, we set him up with a sports program that is academic and behavior based, with a score chart and means of earning points to be able to play in his weekly games. Last year was also the first time he has been involved in sports. Having seen how well he is doing in team sports, that he has really contributed and bought into the systems, and that the heavy handed football coaches really reigned in his attitude, we thought things were going well. We had a few bumps in the road, but had an excellent teacher and staff at his school, and saw everything getting much better until the last month or so of school, which was very rough. We chalked it up to a rough patch in what was otherwise his best year.

Summer he spent a few weeks at his mother's home.

With school now about 3 months in we are about to lose our minds. He just started middle school, so 7 classes per day. We thought this might actually help at first, as he doesn't have time to really get distracted or off task with each class being short. The opposite is the case. We were aware of his struggles, but here is what his grades look like after the first report card.

What's worse, is that there is a direct correlation between his attitude and his grades. We have had MANY discussions with staff at the school, sit downs, one on ones, and more phone calls than I can remember with different staff members, mostly with his Science teacher and Language arts teacher or the principle / vice principle.

He is being very disrespectful to teachers, staff, other kids, etc. Saying very mean things, or just responding with a bad attitude. Often times slamming items, throwing them, and when corrected sometimes ending up screaming at people and having to be escorted out of class. In large part, he has missed about half his classes in Science this year because he gets kicked out of the Language arts class, sent to the office, and they keep him there until the end of the day. When he is missing most of his classes, his grade plummets. He's a smart kid when he applies himself, but lets his attitude and anger just boil up, over seemingly nothing. His fuse in these classes is so short, staff and children both don't know how to act around him and it has alienated him from the bulk of his peers at school too.

We have a routine of how we handle his outbursts now, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in it. We have a heavy reward system for making right choices, and a heavy consequence system for making wrong choices. It seems like physical activity and physical chores can sometimes set him straight for a few days or a week (we do up-down exercises outside while discussing the problem if it's happened more than twice, rain or shine, as he hates that particular exercise and he wants to avoid it when possible). The problem is, we run into the same problem again in a week, or even a few days.

This sucks. I want my kid to have friends, be friendly and do well in school. I don't want to have to be the bad guy all the time, but I feel like that's my life. I rarely get to do fun things with my son because he is always in trouble. I am dreading leaving work in an hour because I just got another call from his science teacher that he had a meltdown today.

I'm not sure what advice can even be given, or if I'm just a frustrated parent who needs to vent. The real issues I have now are that there is a very real possibility that he won't get through the year, and we'll be looking at expulsion. It was very lightly brought up at the last sit down we had, and things aren't improving. It doesn't seem that medication (he was on adderal for a while), therapy (again multiple types), rewards or consequences even matter to him.

We've also ran into him banging his head on things, saying he was a terrible kid and shouldn't be alive....... It's heartbreaking when he gets like this... Those have been isolated and rare incidences, and might be attention grabs he learned from his mom, but he is too young for that stuff. Therapists talk about revelations and success in conquering problems with him, but they don't change any of his behavior.

Have any of you experienced anything similar? How'd it work out? What did you do? It affects my relationship with my son and my relationship with my fiancé poorly. I dread having to go home and tackle these issues every day, and spend the late afternoon waiting for a crappy email or phone call from school."
790,t3_3uxxeh,eddmc,"Is it an option for him to have some tutoring outside of school on one of the subjects that he's not so good at?

I'm wondering if he better understood that subject then he would have more of an interest in the class.

Engineering and Maths are very related subjects - it's odd to me that he's good in one and bad in the other (I guess it could be that they're not doing much maths in the engineering class this year). If he's not doing much maths in engineering yet, then he will be in future years for sure. You could pitch some maths tutoring as important to help him stay at the top of his engineering class next year - especially if you can find out what the teaching plan is for next year. 

I'd also like to say that you are doing a great job here. You clearly care about him and are trying hard to help him. It's great that you're reaching out looking for new ideas.

792,t3_3uxxeh,ReinierPersoon,"Are you sure his acting out is deliberate? Maybe he is trying his best but still failing. It must be really frustrating getting punished all the time. You said you made him do physical exercises as punishment (or that's how I read it), if he does those he is accepting his punishment. Stuff like that never worked with me because I knew the adults couldn't physically make me run around a field unless they dragged me. Clearly the punishment routine isn't working on him.

You mentioned therapy and medicine, but has he actually been diagnosed with something? You need a diagnosis before treatment. The school also doesn't sound very good if they just keep punishing him when obviously it is not working. Why keep doing something if it keeps failing? It's the definition of stupid.

At that age I was also an annoying kid with a lot of anxiety but after a while the teachers figured out they could prevent my outbursts by giving me a short time-out (not as punishment) by sending me for a short walk, and I would go back to class when I was calmer. I actually liked school and learning in general, it was just that it was sometimes a bit overwhelming. I was academically ok but I was a bit immature for my age. If I was getting agitated my teacher would give me a note and tell me to deliver it to another teacher, just like you would misdirect a dog that's acting up :)

I think you need to step back for a moment and think of this from your kids perspective.  When he is at school and having a difficult time, his ADHD brain (I am assuming ADHD because of the Ritalin) is not thinking ""I had an awesome time with my dad yesterday so even though I am feeling super frustrated, hangry, overstimulated, bored, whatever right now - I am going to suppress those feelings out of respect for my dad"".  That is even a complicated thought for a neuro-typical 11 year old.  I hear your frustration (and have felt it personally with my own son) but it wasn't until I started separating the good times from the bad times and think of them as isolated instances as opposed to interconnected - did I truly start to enjoy the times I had with my son.

In this book I particularly love and has helped us deal with our own difficult 8 year old - the author has the parent invite the child to be part of the solution - coming up with a mutually agreeable plan to solve the problem that is causing the melt down.  (The book is The Explosive Child).  Have you asked him what he thinks would help him in school?  Obviously he is going to probably say ""stay home"" but can you help guide him to a solution that works for him and the school?  I find my son is a lot more invested in the outcome when he is included in the planning and the solution.",4,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back. We want him to grow up happy and socially adjusted but nothing has worked. I suppose a bit of background is in order too.

My son's mother and I split up when he was 2 due to a series of poor decisions on her part. She raised him through kindergarten and I took full custody just before first grade. We were working with a lawyer, building a case to take full custody when her health deteriorated badly and she couldn't raise him, so it turned out unneeded because she gave up custody due to her medical condition.

When I took custody of my son I was already living with my now fiancé, so there has been a stable adult presence in his life consistently. We've moved a few times, but our household has remained stable. His mother and her boyfriend whom she lives in live a rather immature lifestyle and think it's funny when my son lies for them, acts out in obscene or lewd ways, or is otherwise gross. My ex also lies, cheats, steals and fucks over other people for her own benefit and when called out on any of this, completely loses her mind and acts like an irrational crazy person and has even resorted to self harm or attempted suicide for big, showy attention grabs (this is relevant later).

When I took full custody of my son was when I realized exactly how bad things were. In school he would completely lose his mind, multiple times a day, throwing massive temper tantrums. This was always when he was put in positions he needed to do things he didn't want. His go to excuse for years was that he ""missed his mom"". She ate this up and encouraged this behavior because she felt like it proved he loved her.

Over the years we have gone through therapists, individually and as a family, even including my ex in some of the family therapy. We have encouraged him, found friends with kids, tried to get him involved in giving back and charity... We have tried to be soft handed, working with him through issues and never getting upset... We have tried being heavy handed and hard on him with consequences and punishments...

Now, we've seen improvement. Just not enough. He is now getting old enough and his mother has checked out of his life in large part, that he no longer bases his behavior on his mother's whim. Also, he has proven that in small doses he can control himself. At home he is kind and respectful to me and my fiancé, and any other authority figures. He behaves with his friends and other kids who might be around us. In large part, he doesn't push us at all and acts perfectly normal/right. So we no longer can ever catch him in the act to help solve these issues. The other issue compounding this is that he lies. He lies about anything and everything that he could even remotely be given negative consequences for, even though he knows lying will make things much worse.

This brings us to last year. With him being fairly well behaved at home and improvements over time, we set him up with a sports program that is academic and behavior based, with a score chart and means of earning points to be able to play in his weekly games. Last year was also the first time he has been involved in sports. Having seen how well he is doing in team sports, that he has really contributed and bought into the systems, and that the heavy handed football coaches really reigned in his attitude, we thought things were going well. We had a few bumps in the road, but had an excellent teacher and staff at his school, and saw everything getting much better until the last month or so of school, which was very rough. We chalked it up to a rough patch in what was otherwise his best year.

Summer he spent a few weeks at his mother's home.

With school now about 3 months in we are about to lose our minds. He just started middle school, so 7 classes per day. We thought this might actually help at first, as he doesn't have time to really get distracted or off task with each class being short. The opposite is the case. We were aware of his struggles, but here is what his grades look like after the first report card.

What's worse, is that there is a direct correlation between his attitude and his grades. We have had MANY discussions with staff at the school, sit downs, one on ones, and more phone calls than I can remember with different staff members, mostly with his Science teacher and Language arts teacher or the principle / vice principle.

He is being very disrespectful to teachers, staff, other kids, etc. Saying very mean things, or just responding with a bad attitude. Often times slamming items, throwing them, and when corrected sometimes ending up screaming at people and having to be escorted out of class. In large part, he has missed about half his classes in Science this year because he gets kicked out of the Language arts class, sent to the office, and they keep him there until the end of the day. When he is missing most of his classes, his grade plummets. He's a smart kid when he applies himself, but lets his attitude and anger just boil up, over seemingly nothing. His fuse in these classes is so short, staff and children both don't know how to act around him and it has alienated him from the bulk of his peers at school too.

We have a routine of how we handle his outbursts now, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in it. We have a heavy reward system for making right choices, and a heavy consequence system for making wrong choices. It seems like physical activity and physical chores can sometimes set him straight for a few days or a week (we do up-down exercises outside while discussing the problem if it's happened more than twice, rain or shine, as he hates that particular exercise and he wants to avoid it when possible). The problem is, we run into the same problem again in a week, or even a few days.

This sucks. I want my kid to have friends, be friendly and do well in school. I don't want to have to be the bad guy all the time, but I feel like that's my life. I rarely get to do fun things with my son because he is always in trouble. I am dreading leaving work in an hour because I just got another call from his science teacher that he had a meltdown today.

I'm not sure what advice can even be given, or if I'm just a frustrated parent who needs to vent. The real issues I have now are that there is a very real possibility that he won't get through the year, and we'll be looking at expulsion. It was very lightly brought up at the last sit down we had, and things aren't improving. It doesn't seem that medication (he was on adderal for a while), therapy (again multiple types), rewards or consequences even matter to him.

We've also ran into him banging his head on things, saying he was a terrible kid and shouldn't be alive....... It's heartbreaking when he gets like this... Those have been isolated and rare incidences, and might be attention grabs he learned from his mom, but he is too young for that stuff. Therapists talk about revelations and success in conquering problems with him, but they don't change any of his behavior.

Have any of you experienced anything similar? How'd it work out? What did you do? It affects my relationship with my son and my relationship with my fiancé poorly. I dread having to go home and tackle these issues every day, and spend the late afternoon waiting for a crappy email or phone call from school."
794,t3_3uxxeh,ChaosShifter,"We could attempt this again. We tried this a few years ago when he was younger and dropped punishments all together, instead focusing on discussing problems and working on solutions. This didn't ever really improve the outbursts or behavior at school though (we did it for about 4 months).

Now we do both. The system sort of works like this unless it's something immensely out of the ordinary or extreme.

Outburst about being unprepared for class #1: We sit down and discuss the problem calmly. Working out a plan to prevent it from happening again. We try to have him help with the solution, so he can take ownership of it.

Outburst about being unprepared for class #2: We discuss why our previous plan didn't work, or wasn't used. This conversation is usually a bit more forceful, with a lot more gravity over why it is important and the consequences of the action, how it impacts him and others. We modify the plan if necessary. Although this can sometimes turn into a bit more of a lecture. This is also where he loses a privilege of some kind (Sleepover lost, or video games, or something of that nature)

Outburst about being unprepared for class #3: He and I go outside and do up downs or some other intense exercise that he doesn't enjoy while discussing the problem. During the end of last school year we had a bunch of landscape work we were doing in the back yard that we were doing instead of exercise, but the point is the same. The focus of this is for him to explain why it is continuing to be a problem and how we are going to fix it in a way that will work better or be different than last time.

After that, we repeat number 3, working longer or harder as it becomes harder for us to come up with new or better solutions

795,t3_3uxxeh,also_HIM,"I don't have any easy answers. One *extreme* example would be to move him to another school so he can have a fresh start - where he doesn't have teachers and classmates already treating him with the expectation that he's a problem, where he can get an opportunity to do a reset of his own expectations for himself. But that's probably a bigger change than you want to try at this point.

Another way to change the situation (break this cycle) is cut out the punishments wherever you can. (I'm in agreement with /u/spinzard here.) It doesn't seem to be working and it probably exacerbates his bad feelings about himself (especially if he's grounded all the time as you seem to imply in another post). In particular, the school's habit of holding him in the office all afternoon sounds immensely counterproductive for a variety of reasons but you may have little success altering that.

But read the book, it's better than anything I can come up with. Good luck! ",1,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back.

This was always when he was put in positions he needed to do things he didn't want. His go to excuse for years was that he ""missed his mom"". She ate this up and encouraged this behavior because she felt like it proved he loved her.

Over the years we have gone through therapists, individually and as a family, even including my ex in some of the family therapy. We have encouraged him, found friends with kids, tried to get him involved in giving back and charity... We have tried to be soft handed, working with him through issues and never getting upset... We have tried being heavy handed and hard on him with consequences and punishments...

Now, we've seen improvement. Just not enough. He is now getting old enough and his mother has checked out of his life in large part, that he no longer bases his behavior on his mother's whim. Also, he has proven that in small doses he can control himself. At home he is kind and respectful to me and my fiancé, and any other authority figures. He behaves with his friends and other kids who might be around us. In large part, he doesn't push us at all and acts perfectly normal/right. So we no longer can ever catch him in the act to help solve these issues. The other issue compounding this is that he lies. He lies about anything and everything that he could even remotely be given negative consequences for, even though he knows lying will make things much worse.

This brings us to last year. With him being fairly well behaved at home and improvements over time, we set him up with a sports program that is academic and behavior based, with a score chart and means of earning points to be able to play in his weekly games. Last year was also the first time he has been involved in sports. Having seen how well he is doing in team sports, that he has really contributed and bought into the systems, and that the heavy handed football coaches really reigned in his attitude, we thought things were going well. We had a few bumps in the road, but had an excellent teacher and staff at his school, and saw everything getting much better until the last month or so of school, which was very rough. We chalked it up to a rough patch in what was otherwise his best year.

Summer he spent a few weeks at his mother's home.

With school now about 3 months in we are about to lose our minds. He just started middle school, so 7 classes per day. We thought this might actually help at first, as he doesn't have time to really get distracted or off task with each class being short. The opposite is the case. We were aware of his struggles, but here is what his grades look like after the first report card.

What's worse, is that there is a direct correlation between his attitude and his grades. We have had MANY discussions with staff at the school, sit downs, one on ones, and more phone calls than I can remember with different staff members, mostly with his Science teacher and Language arts teacher or the principle / vice principle.

He is being very disrespectful to teachers, staff, other kids, etc. Saying very mean things, or just responding with a bad attitude. Often times slamming items, throwing them, and when corrected sometimes ending up screaming at people and having to be escorted out of class. In large part, he has missed about half his classes in Science this year because he gets kicked out of the Language arts class, sent to the office, and they keep him there until the end of the day. When he is missing most of his classes, his grade plummets. He's a smart kid when he applies himself, but lets his attitude and anger just boil up, over seemingly nothing. His fuse in these classes is so short, staff and children both don't know how to act around him and it has alienated him from the bulk of his peers at school too.

We have a routine of how we handle his outbursts now, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in it. We have a heavy reward system for making right choices, and a heavy consequence system for making wrong choices. It seems like physical activity and physical chores can sometimes set him straight for a few days or a week (we do up-down exercises outside while discussing the problem if it's happened more than twice, rain or shine, as he hates that particular exercise and he wants to avoid it when possible). The problem is, we run into the same problem again in a week, or even a few days.

This sucks. I want my kid to have friends, be friendly and do well in school. I don't want to have to be the bad guy all the time, but I feel like that's my life. I rarely get to do fun things with my son because he is always in trouble. I am dreading leaving work in an hour because I just got another call from his science teacher that he had a meltdown today.

I'm not sure what advice can even be given, or if I'm just a frustrated parent who needs to vent. The real issues I have now are that there is a very real possibility that he won't get through the year, and we'll be looking at expulsion. It was very lightly brought up at the last sit down we had, and things aren't improving. It doesn't seem that medication (he was on adderal for a while), therapy (again multiple types), rewards or consequences even matter to him.

We've also ran into him banging his head on things, saying he was a terrible kid and shouldn't be alive....... It's heartbreaking when he gets like this... Those have been isolated and rare incidences, and might be attention grabs he learned from his mom, but he is too young for that stuff. Therapists talk about revelations and success in conquering problems with him, but they don't change any of his behavior.

Have any of you experienced anything similar? How'd it work out? What did you do? It affects my relationship with my son and my relationship with my fiancé poorly. I dread having to go home and tackle these issues every day, and spend the late afternoon waiting for a crappy email or phone call from school."
798,t3_3uxxeh,ChaosShifter,"I honestly believe this would solve much of the issue. If his core classes were early in the day and the electives he enjoys so much were near the end for him to look forward to. The school says they are looking into this, but that was a month ago and they haven't found a solution yet.",2,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back. We want him to grow up happy and socially adjusted but nothing has worked. I suppose a bit of background is in order too.

My son's mother and I split up when he was 2 due to a series of poor decisions on her part. She raised him through kindergarten and I took full custody just before first grade. We were working with a lawyer, building a case to take full custody when her health deteriorated badly and she couldn't raise him, so it turned out unneeded because she gave up custody due to her medical condition.

When I took custody of my son I was already living with my now fiancé, so there has been a stable adult presence in his life consistently. We've moved a few times, but our household has remained stable. His mother and her boyfriend whom she lives in live a rather immature lifestyle and think it's funny when my son lies for them, acts out in obscene or lewd ways, or is otherwise gross.

799,t3_3uxxeh,ChaosShifter,"That is an option to consider that we haven't really explored yet. Although I'm not sure that it's so much an issue of him not being good at the subjects, as not being in the class as much as he should be. The classes his grades are lower in are the ones he struggles to control his outbursts in and subsequently gets sent out of the class, to the office and misses the rest of that class and sometimes the next class (hence why his last class of the day is his worst grade). He is actually pretty bright, and I work with him on homework. He seems to handle math homework like a champ and grasps concepts quickly, so I think most of the disconnect with the grades are due to class participation, in class quiz and tests, etc.

Thank you for the kind words!",2,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back. We want him to grow up happy and socially adjusted but nothing has worked. I suppose a bit of background is in order too.

800,t3_3uxxeh,ChaosShifter,"You know, I am not really sure what goes through his head when his attitude changes. Like I mentioned before, these problems were curbed at home early on. We see none of it at all. Discussing things with him has revealed a number of excuses but little that he has been able to really latch onto.

As for the punishment thing, the exercise thing is something that we do together when we are frustrated talking through things. I do it as much for me, as him. It helps me blow off steam and it's something we started in the last few months. Before it ever gets to that point we have had a few heart to hearts. It's only when things get repetitive that we resort to that.

The school has implemented a number of things, the most recent is a bit of handing notes to him to remind him of his attitude. I am hoping to see some progress here.

As for medication, he was diagnosed at 8 with ADHD. Although medication over the course of a year, with adjustments of dosing, didn't seem to help much except for his ability to focus and get his work done, and did nothing for his attitude. He has since overcome that and seems capable of focusing on his work and completing it, but the attitude issues remain.",5,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back.

We had a few bumps in the road, but had an excellent teacher and staff at his school, and saw everything getting much better until the last month or so of school, which was very rough. We chalked it up to a rough patch in what was otherwise his best year.

Summer he spent a few weeks at his mother's home.

With school now about 3 months in we are about to lose our minds. He just started middle school, so 7 classes per day. We thought this might actually help at first, as he doesn't have time to really get distracted or off task with each class being short. The opposite is the case. We were aware of his struggles, but here is what his grades look like after the first report card.

What's worse, is that there is a direct correlation between his attitude and his grades. We have had MANY discussions with staff at the school, sit downs, one on ones, and more phone calls than I can remember with different staff members, mostly with his Science teacher and Language arts teacher or the principle / vice principle.

He is being very disrespectful to teachers, staff, other kids, etc. Saying very mean things, or just responding with a bad attitude. Often times slamming items, throwing them, and when corrected sometimes ending up screaming at people and having to be escorted out of class. In large part, he has missed about half his classes in Science this year because he gets kicked out of the Language arts class, sent to the office, and they keep him there until the end of the day. When he is missing most of his classes, his grade plummets. He's a smart kid when he applies himself, but lets his attitude and anger just boil up, over seemingly nothing. His fuse in these classes is so short, staff and children both don't know how to act around him and it has alienated him from the bulk of his peers at school too.

We have a routine of how we handle his outbursts now, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in it. We have a heavy reward system for making right choices, and a heavy consequence system for making wrong choices. It seems like physical activity and physical chores can sometimes set him straight for a few days or a week (we do up-down exercises outside while discussing the problem if it's happened more than twice, rain or shine, as he hates that particular exercise and he wants to avoid it when possible). The problem is, we run into the same problem again in a week, or even a few days.

This sucks. I want my kid to have friends, be friendly and do well in school. I don't want to have to be the bad guy all the time, but I feel like that's my life. I rarely get to do fun things with my son because he is always in trouble. I am dreading leaving work in an hour because I just got another call from his science teacher that he had a meltdown today.

I'm not sure what advice can even be given, or if I'm just a frustrated parent who needs to vent. The real issues I have now are that there is a very real possibility that he won't get through the year, and we'll be looking at expulsion. It was very lightly brought up at the last sit down we had, and things aren't improving. It doesn't seem that medication (he was on adderal for a while), therapy (again multiple types), rewards or consequences even matter to him.

We've also ran into him banging his head on things, saying he was a terrible kid and shouldn't be alive....... It's heartbreaking when he gets like this... Those have been isolated and rare incidences, and might be attention grabs he learned from his mom, but he is too young for that stuff. Therapists talk about revelations and success in conquering problems with him, but they don't change any of his behavior.

Have any of you experienced anything similar? How'd it work out? What did you do? It affects my relationship with my son and my relationship with my fiancé poorly. I dread having to go home and tackle these issues every day, and spend the late afternoon waiting for a crappy email or phone call from school."
802,t3_3uxxeh,ChaosShifter,"I absolutely don't believe my son is doing what he is doing to spite me at all. He craves (and receives) my attention constantly, in a positive way. However so often I am put into a position of enforcer of rules and the authority figure. Mostly it's just that I'm so burnt out dealing with the negative aspects, it's damaging my enjoyment of the positive ones. That is more a personal issue of mine, than something that I think he is actively trying to cause.

I will absolutely get a copy of the book and see if we can take anything from it to look into. We've discussed plans, tried to work out solutions, and they have had varying degrees of success before he seems to give up on them. Now, he just says he ""doesn't know"". His solution has absolutely never been ""stay home"". He likes school, for all his struggles with it. As an only child, he enjoys the time he gets to see his couple of friends at school. He loves his Engineering class, Band and sports when they are in season. I don't think he would choose to stay home, even if given the opportunity.",1,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back.

We were working with a lawyer, building a case to take full custody when her health deteriorated badly and she couldn't raise him, so it turned out unneeded because she gave up custody due to her medical condition.

When I took custody of my son I was already living with my now fiancé, so there has been a stable adult presence in his life consistently. We've moved a few times, but our household has remained stable. His mother and her boyfriend whom she lives in live a rather immature lifestyle and think it's funny when my son lies for them, acts out in obscene or lewd ways, or is otherwise gross.

We have encouraged him, found friends with kids, tried to get him involved in giving back and charity... We have tried to be soft handed, working with him through issues and never getting upset... We have tried being heavy handed and hard on him with consequences and punishments...

Now, we've seen improvement. Just not enough. He is now getting old enough and his mother has checked out of his life in large part, that he no longer bases his behavior on his mother's whim. Also, he has proven that in small doses he can control himself. At home he is kind and respectful to me and my fiancé, and any other authority figures. He behaves with his friends and other kids who might be around us. In large part, he doesn't push us at all and acts perfectly normal/right.

It is extremely awesome.  It's an international science fair and a robot building and programming sport.  
Your team develops a hypothetical solution to the year's ""challenge"" and researches and puts together a poster board and presentation.  
Then they use a Lego [Mindstorms](http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/products/31313-mindstorms-ev3) programmable brick (and any other Lego they want) to make a robot that can drive itself through an [obstacle course](http://www.cvrobotics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/722922.jpg) and accomplish tasks.  

There's also a Jr level and then in middle and high school it switches from Lego to full robotics.

805,t3_3uxxeh,ReinierPersoon,"Attitude problem sort of implies that he does it deliberately, but I don't think that is the case. What is his explanation for his outbursts? Can he explain what he is feeling before it happens, anger or anxiety or something like that? The school seems to focus on punishment but not on what is actually happening. If he lashes out because of anxiety or it comes from another 'bad place' in his mind, then punishment is completely useless because he can't help it.

I highly suspect I have Asperger's or some form of autism, but they didn't know about that when I was young. When I read the wikipedia article about Asperger's it was like reading my biography as a kid. I liked learning but being in the classroom with so many people was overwhelming and I was always anxious at school. The first few years of primary school were bad because I would refuse to do the work and was being a general nuisance, but around the age of 10 I got a bunch of teachers that understood me and they would let me wander around in the hallway of the school to calm myself. My grades went up and I got a gymnasium recommendation (I'm in the Netherlands) that you only get with high grades. Before that I would sometimes even attack adults when I was upset, I punched my swimming instructor a few times. I was a little shit when I was anxious but very peaceful and mostly reasonable when I was calm, aside from general immaturity every kid has.

My feeling is that your son is not doing it deliberately, otherwise he would have learned to behave himself by now because of all the punishments. He clearly understands he is being punished and even being labeled a bad kid. Which is twice as bad if he is really trying but can't control himself for some reason. Reward and punishment only work when someone is thinking rationally, when they are upset for some reason all that goes out the window.",7,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back.

We thought this might actually help at first, as he doesn't have time to really get distracted or off task with each class being short. The opposite is the case. We were aware of his struggles, but here is what his grades look like after the first report card.

What's worse, is that there is a direct correlation between his attitude and his grades. We have had MANY discussions with staff at the school, sit downs, one on ones, and more phone calls than I can remember with different staff members, mostly with his Science teacher and Language arts teacher or the principle / vice principle.

He is being very disrespectful to teachers, staff, other kids, etc. Saying very mean things, or just responding with a bad attitude. Often times slamming items, throwing them, and when corrected sometimes ending up screaming at people and having to be escorted out of class. In large part, he has missed about half his classes in Science this year because he gets kicked out of the Language arts class, sent to the office, and they keep him there until the end of the day. When he is missing most of his classes, his grade plummets. He's a smart kid when he applies himself, but lets his attitude and anger just boil up, over seemingly nothing. His fuse in these classes is so short, staff and children both don't know how to act around him and it has alienated him from the bulk of his peers at school too.

We have a routine of how we handle his outbursts now, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in it. We have a heavy reward system for making right choices, and a heavy consequence system for making wrong choices. It seems like physical activity and physical chores can sometimes set him straight for a few days or a week (we do up-down exercises outside while discussing the problem if it's happened more than twice, rain or shine, as he hates that particular exercise and he wants to avoid it when possible). The problem is, we run into the same problem again in a week, or even a few days.

This sucks. I want my kid to have friends, be friendly and do well in school. I don't want to have to be the bad guy all the time, but I feel like that's my life. I rarely get to do fun things with my son because he is always in trouble. I am dreading leaving work in an hour because I just got another call from his science teacher that he had a meltdown today.

I'm not sure what advice can even be given, or if I'm just a frustrated parent who needs to vent. The real issues I have now are that there is a very real possibility that he won't get through the year, and we'll be looking at expulsion. It was very lightly brought up at the last sit down we had, and things aren't improving. It doesn't seem that medication (he was on adderal for a while), therapy (again multiple types), rewards or consequences even matter to him.

We've also ran into him banging his head on things, saying he was a terrible kid and shouldn't be alive....... It's heartbreaking when he gets like this... Those have been isolated and rare incidences, and might be attention grabs he learned from his mom, but he is too young for that stuff. Therapists talk about revelations and success in conquering problems with him, but they don't change any of his behavior.

Have any of you experienced anything similar? How'd it work out? What did you do? It affects my relationship with my son and my relationship with my fiancé poorly. I dread having to go home and tackle these issues every day, and spend the late afternoon waiting for a crappy email or phone call from school."
806,t3_3uxxeh,nmmb,We by no means get it right all the time but it gave us such insight on our son - it really changed our whole world.  ,2,"So we're at a loss of how to help my 11 year old son and regain a small semblance of our sanity back. We want him to grow up happy and socially adjusted but nothing has worked. I suppose a bit of background is in order too.

My son's mother and I split up when he was 2 due to a series of poor decisions on her part. She raised him through kindergarten and I took full custody just before first grade. We were working with a lawyer, building a case to take full custody when her health deteriorated badly and she couldn't raise him, so it turned out unneeded because she gave up custody due to her medical condition.

When I took custody of my son I was already living with my now fiancé, so there has been a stable adult presence in his life consistently. We've moved a few times, but our household has remained stable. His mother and her boyfriend whom she lives in live a rather immature lifestyle and think it's funny when my son lies for them, acts out in obscene or lewd ways, or is otherwise gross. My ex also lies, cheats, steals and fucks over other people for her own benefit and when called out on any of this, completely loses her mind and acts like an irrational crazy person and has even resorted to self harm or attempted suicide for big, showy attention grabs (this is relevant later).

When I took full custody of my son was when I realized exactly how bad things were. In school he would completely lose his mind, multiple times a day, throwing massive temper tantrums. This was always when he was put in positions he needed to do things he didn't want. His go to excuse for years was that he ""missed his mom"". She ate this up and encouraged this behavior because she felt like it proved he loved her.

Over the years we have gone through therapists, individually and as a family, even including my ex in some of the family therapy. We have encouraged him, found friends with kids, tried to get him involved in giving back and charity... We have tried to be soft handed, working with him through issues and never getting upset... We have tried being heavy handed and hard on him with consequences and punishments...

Now, we've seen improvement. Just not enough. He is now getting old enough and his mother has checked out of his life in large part, that he no longer bases his behavior on his mother's whim. Also, he has proven that in small doses he can control himself. At home he is kind and respectful to me and my fiancé, and any other authority figures. He behaves with his friends and other kids who might be around us. In large part, he doesn't push us at all and acts perfectly normal/right. So we no longer can ever catch him in the act to help solve these issues. The other issue compounding this is that he lies. He lies about anything and everything that he could even remotely be given negative consequences for, even though he knows lying will make things much worse.

This brings us to last year. With him being fairly well behaved at home and improvements over time, we set him up with a sports program that is academic and behavior based, with a score chart and means of earning points to be able to play in his weekly games. Last year was also the first time he has been involved in sports. Having seen how well he is doing in team sports, that he has really contributed and bought into the systems, and that the heavy handed football coaches really reigned in his attitude, we thought things were going well. We had a few bumps in the road, but had an excellent teacher and staff at his school, and saw everything getting much better until the last month or so of school, which was very rough. We chalked it up to a rough patch in what was otherwise his best year.

808,t3_3uxxeh,ChaosShifter,"The explanation varies. Sometimes he just doesn't know. Other times he is frustrated with someone else not accepting his opinion or answer as the correct one. Other times still it's over things not related to school at all.

A few examples.

""Tylar wasn't listening to me. I thought I was right and he kept saying I was wrong. I got frustrated and started yelling thinking it would get my point across"".

""I couldn't find my log journal. The class was starting and I couldn't find it in my bag and I got angry""

""I was feeling sad I didn't get to see my mom when she said she would come visit and didn't show up. I felt angry and wanted everyone else to feel the same way so they might show curiosity into my problem"" (I clarified he was looking for others to show empathy, but going about it the absolute wrong way and not utilizing the others whom he has to talk to about such things)

These are just a few examples. Some of these are big issues that definitely point to some serious disconnect (his mom). Others are seemingly mundane and wouldn't warrant a meltdown from most (the log journal).

I haven't ever looked into the Aspergers thing, but this thread has now got me with a few tabs open looking into it. It's something I can discuss with his doctor, and not something anyone in our circle has previously suggested. From what I am reading, this may be part of the problem.

841,t3_4o2w8l,in8joy,"Lots of kids have trouble verbalizing their emotions. They have BIG feelings, but limited ability to express them. Look into doing some emotional intelligence type activities. If you still read to him, find books that focus on managing feelings. If you can find things that look at OTHER people's feelings, that can be less threatening. E.g. that person just got in trouble! How do you think he feels? Why do you think he feels that way? etc. Talk with him about how YOU feel when you get in trouble. Talk about where feelings happen in the body. Next time he does this, try empathizing:

Son: I hate myself

Parent: you feel really bad because you got in trouble

Son: I wish I was dead

Parent: wow, that's a strong statement. You're REALLY upset. When I get in trouble, sometimes I feel ashamed/sad/frustrated/hopeless/unloveable etc. Does that happen to you?

Hopefully he will get a better idea of how to appropriately express himself. If you don't feel able to do this yourself, find a good family therapist.",30,"So, basically what the title says. This started at home and has made its way into public school and summer camp. 

Overall, my son is overall well-behaved, but like most boys, he becomes rambunctious. It’s often mild things like reminding him to keep his voice down, stop running in the house, and don’t hang on the furniture (literally like a monkey). Sometimes when we (my husband and I) “get on to him,” he will say things like, “I hate myself” or he will hit himself in the face or on the head. Not hard enough to do any damage, but it is disconcerting. He has also said things in the past like, “I’m a bad boy.” At first, my husband I approached this cautiously, reminding him that overall he does a lot of good things and he is a good boy. That doing bad things every now and then (I mean, they aren’t even that bad) doesn’t make you a “bad boy.” My husband and I don’t even use the term “bad boy.”

So, onto this past school year. He just “graduated” from first grade. His first grade teacher called me once this past year to inform me about his behavior. That when she tries to correct his behavior, he says, “I hate myself” and will hit himself. Again, my husband and I sat him down and talked to him about this. Since we weren’t present for the actions, I tried to tell him that that behavior is inappropriate. When an adult tells you to do something (or not do something), then you do just that and that’s it. No hitting. No saying, “I hate myself.”

Weeks pass. The school counselor calls. Now, my son said to the teacher, “I hate myself. I want to kill myself.” Oh boy. The school counselor puts him at low risk since this is a single incident, and he’s 7. The school counselor also had a conversation with him about death. Based on her questions, while he understands the basics of death, he doesn’t understand what all it encompasses. So, she felt like he was low risk.

I talk to him about it later that night. I ask him if he’s serious about killing himself or “pretending.” He says “pretending.” I give him a lengthy conversation about how teachers and mom and dad will be very worried if you say you’re going to kill yourself. That if he was ever serious about it, I would get him help with a doctor, but if he’s just saying it to say it, he can’t do that.

The rest of the school year seemed to go by without a hitch.

This brings us to yesterday. My son is in summer camp for the entire summer. When I go to pick him up yesterday, there’s a note for me.

“We are concerned by the way SON handles discipline. He is a very good kid, but the two times he has gotten into trouble, he has become so upset and mad at himself that he’s attempted to hurt himself – banging his head on the table, hitting himself on the head, and saying he wants to give himself carpet burn. We would appreciate it if you could talk to him about his response to our discipline because it is very disconcerting.”

To explain the carpet burn part: on the last day of school, my son got carpet burn on his forehead because I guess he didn’t realize you could hurt yourself by running your forehead against the carpet. He came home with a big scab on his forehead, and after asking what happened, I told him that it was carpet burn.

Anyway, I thought we had gotten passed this. I read the letter out loud to my son. When this first started happening, I wanted to be empathetic, but now I’m just upset. I really think he does this for 2 reasons: 1. He doesn’t know how to react to discipline/it makes him uncomfortable and 2. Attention-seeking. I told him that he only needs to say 2 things when he gets in trouble: 1. I’m sorry and 2. Yes, ma’am/sir. That’s it. My husband threatened to take him out of summer camp.

I’ll be honest that I didn’t like discipline growing up and would often feel like curling up into a ball. But to hit myself or threaten harm to myself? I have a hard time empathizing with that. I’m hoping this is the last time I have to deal with this, but if it isn’t, I’d like to know how I should react next time it might happen.

Does anyone have experience with this? Suggestions?"
842,t3_4o2w8l,d-daybuttercup,"One of my favorite sayings my sister used after being a preschool teacher was ""We do not hurt anyone, that includes ourselves."" For kids who were self harming. I have a niece that would hit herself or hit her head on the wall, and after a few reminders she stopped. Self harm came with the same punishment that hitting another child would get. It sounds like he definitely needs to learn how to deal with that uncomfortable feeling.  
  
Maybe trying to get him to voice what he is feeling right when it happens. And then working with him to learn how to interpret that feeling into something that isn't self harm. He also may not have the words to properly describe what he is feeling. So maybe describing them to him. Like ashamed, guilty, embarrassed, frustrated (he probably knows them but just in case). He needs to know that it's perfectly normal to feel that way, but he needs to express it differently.",12,"So, basically what the title says.

843,t3_4o2w8l,catloving,"My thinking: how negative is the first reprimand, and does HE think it's over rated?
Such as ""Pat, please wipe that up before someone slips on it."" 
Pat ignores and does other stuff. You again tell Pat, ""Please wipe that up, it's dangerous"" Pat starts hollering ""I hate you hate self life dies death rraaaah""...

Ok, so he's having XXXX reaction over (in your mind) yy reprimand/speech/instruction that critcizes him. His reaction does not equal your expected response. 

First: he's getting attention one way or another, whether sassing you, complaining/whining, or yelling and self harm (light version)

Second: his response to your comments is extreme, and loud in some format - verbal, physical.

I suggest counseling for this, but for now, get him an outlet of some form. Try going opposite of his response, let's say he bashes his head some how; get him to do something quiet. He would have to redirect himself AND go to a quieter calmer zone in his head. 

Something else that pops in my head: when you or I stub a toe or slightly burn finger, don't you kind of wave your hand around flapping it or doing something else like hopping? That supposedly distracts your brain from single intense pain to annoying floppy hand larger annoying feeling. Is he doing THAT? Is he having ""omg death I screwed up I suck aaargh can't deal can't deal can't deal confused frustrated aaaaa"" **HEADBASH**? Maybe his thoughts feelings are too big (someone else said) to verbalize and get out? This is where therapy comes in (and for now, maybe drawing or writing or something to 'doodle' out the issue in his head)

I use these own techniques for myself when I get anxious or feel squirrely or get overwhelmed! I redirect to calmer activities, and the issue kind of hushes itself as I am busy, then I can talk to my cat (not kidding) or journal to express it. If you want - tell him this, it's not just him that would need it, I'm 41, took me a while to learn it.",2,"So, basically what the title says.

844,t3_4o2w8l,CDragon00,"It may simply be that he happened upon this as a way to get  people to stop disciplining him, but I'd sure want to have a solo or family session or two with a therapist/counselor just to be sure there isn't something else going on. Seven is not too young to experience depression or feelings of worthlessness. If he's just playing a game here, he needs to be set straight and led to understand that that is something we do not joke about, there is not a time when it's fun or funny to bluff about that. If he is having trouble just expressing his dislike of being disciplined, then you can help educate him about those feelings of shame and defiance that we all feel when someone points out that we screwed up, and how to handle it. The right therapist would also be great at helping to teach him this.

That doing bad things every now and then (I mean, they aren’t even that bad) doesn’t make you a “bad boy.” My husband and I don’t even use the term “bad boy.”

So, onto this past school year. He just “graduated” from first grade. His first grade teacher called me once this past year to inform me about his behavior. That when she tries to correct his behavior, he says, “I hate myself” and will hit himself. Again, my husband and I sat him down and talked to him about this. Since we weren’t present for the actions, I tried to tell him that that behavior is inappropriate. When an adult tells you to do something (or not do something), then you do just that and that’s it. No hitting. No saying, “I hate myself.”

Weeks pass. The school counselor calls. Now, my son said to the teacher, “I hate myself. I want to kill myself.” Oh boy. The school counselor puts him at low risk since this is a single incident, and he’s 7. The school counselor also had a conversation with him about death. Based on her questions, while he understands the basics of death, he doesn’t understand what all it encompasses. So, she felt like he was low risk.

I talk to him about it later that night. I ask him if he’s serious about killing himself or “pretending.” He says “pretending.” I give him a lengthy conversation about how teachers and mom and dad will be very worried if you say you’re going to kill yourself. That if he was ever serious about it, I would get him help with a doctor, but if he’s just saying it to say it, he can’t do that.

The rest of the school year seemed to go by without a hitch.

This brings us to yesterday. My son is in summer camp for the entire summer. When I go to pick him up yesterday, there’s a note for me.

“We are concerned by the way SON handles discipline. He is a very good kid, but the two times he has gotten into trouble, he has become so upset and mad at himself that he’s attempted to hurt himself – banging his head on the table, hitting himself on the head, and saying he wants to give himself carpet burn. We would appreciate it if you could talk to him about his response to our discipline because it is very disconcerting.”

To explain the carpet burn part: on the last day of school, my son got carpet burn on his forehead because I guess he didn’t realize you could hurt yourself by running your forehead against the carpet. He came home with a big scab on his forehead, and after asking what happened, I told him that it was carpet burn.

Anyway, I thought we had gotten passed this. I read the letter out loud to my son. When this first started happening, I wanted to be empathetic, but now I’m just upset. I really think he does this for 2 reasons: 1. He doesn’t know how to react to discipline/it makes him uncomfortable and 2. Attention-seeking. I told him that he only needs to say 2 things when he gets in trouble: 1. I’m sorry and 2. Yes, ma’am/sir. That’s it. My husband threatened to take him out of summer camp.

I’ll be honest that I didn’t like discipline growing up and would often feel like curling up into a ball. But to hit myself or threaten harm to myself? I have a hard time empathizing with that. I’m hoping this is the last time I have to deal with this, but if it isn’t, I’d like to know how I should react next time it might happen.

Does anyone have experience with this? Suggestions?"

846,t3_4o2w8l,,"Depending on how urgent you feel about this problem, you may need a family counselor. I know a great one if you need recommendation. She works nationally and internationally over sktpe and does a wonderful job bringing peace to families. 

Having said that, I really want to discourage you from offering instructions on how to handle situations. He clearly is not capable of thinking and responding that way and we humans cannot tell other humans to feel a certain way. He is going too far with his words but that is because his emotions take him so far. When he is already in distress, telling him to not express that much distress and take other people's feeling(disturbance) into account is asking way too much than he can handle. Think of how you would feel if you are having an intense moment of self hate feeling you are not good enough and having friends or families freak out or say ""you are a good girl."" Or ""still you shouldn't say that."" Your boy might feel even more inadequate feeling he is now failing with self regulation.

It is really great he still is verbal about his hurt feelings and not hiding it from you. I have many friends who never got to express how they felt when treated a certain way by their parents and have serious psychological, emotional issues which they also hide from their parents. Some of them developed physical self harm technique as well and the hatred coming from feeling like a failure from doing such a taboo thing would make it worse. I am relieved for you that you have a challenging nevertheless trusting son who is relying on your guidance. 

I think your husband is wise thinking he should be home. There are many more chances for camp in the future but building his self esteem can't wait. He doesn't need to hear that he is a good boy because most likely he will still fear failing to be a good boy. He needs to experience your love even when he is a ""bad boy."" When he is grounded in himself and trusts you for the source of unconditional love, he won't need teachers to give the same approval. Right now he is insecure in his heart, so any grownups action make him feel this way but that can really change if you work on it. ",0,"So, basically what the title says.

I'd imagine the scenario going something like this away from home.

- Adult: You are in time out young man
- Son: I hate myself and want to die!
- Adult: Oh no sweetie, that's such a strong word. Oh are you ok? You poor thing. 

Kids only do things that are rewarded one way or another, be it attention or otherwise. Assuming he doesn't have a mental illness or something deeper going on, I'd tell them to discipline him for being disrespectful during punishment. Make it not worth the payoff.

He's not adopted.",3,"So, basically what the title says. This started at home and has made its way into public school and summer camp. 

Overall, my son is overall well-behaved, but like most boys, he becomes rambunctious. It’s often mild things like reminding him to keep his voice down, stop running in the house, and don’t hang on the furniture (literally like a monkey). Sometimes when we (my husband and I) “get on to him,” he will say things like, “I hate myself” or he will hit himself in the face or on the head. Not hard enough to do any damage, but it is disconcerting. He has also said things in the past like, “I’m a bad boy.” At first, my husband I approached this cautiously, reminding him that overall he does a lot of good things and he is a good boy. That doing bad things every now and then (I mean, they aren’t even that bad) doesn’t make you a “bad boy.” My husband and I don’t even use the term “bad boy.”

So, onto this past school year. He just “graduated” from first grade. His first grade teacher called me once this past year to inform me about his behavior. That when she tries to correct his behavior, he says, “I hate myself” and will hit himself. Again, my husband and I sat him down and talked to him about this. Since we weren’t present for the actions, I tried to tell him that that behavior is inappropriate. When an adult tells you to do something (or not do something), then you do just that and that’s it. No hitting. No saying, “I hate myself.”

Weeks pass. The school counselor calls. Now, my son said to the teacher, “I hate myself. I want to kill myself.” Oh boy. The school counselor puts him at low risk since this is a single incident, and he’s 7. The school counselor also had a conversation with him about death. Based on her questions, while he understands the basics of death, he doesn’t understand what all it encompasses. So, she felt like he was low risk.

I talk to him about it later that night. I ask him if he’s serious about killing himself or “pretending.” He says “pretending.” I give him a lengthy conversation about how teachers and mom and dad will be very worried if you say you’re going to kill yourself. That if he was ever serious about it, I would get him help with a doctor, but if he’s just saying it to say it, he can’t do that.

The rest of the school year seemed to go by without a hitch.

This brings us to yesterday. My son is in summer camp for the entire summer. When I go to pick him up yesterday, there’s a note for me.

“We are concerned by the way SON handles discipline. He is a very good kid, but the two times he has gotten into trouble, he has become so upset and mad at himself that he’s attempted to hurt himself – banging his head on the table, hitting himself on the head, and saying he wants to give himself carpet burn. We would appreciate it if you could talk to him about his response to our discipline because it is very disconcerting.”

To explain the carpet burn part: on the last day of school, my son got carpet burn on his forehead because I guess he didn’t realize you could hurt yourself by running your forehead against the carpet. He came home with a big scab on his forehead, and after asking what happened, I told him that it was carpet burn.

Anyway, I thought we had gotten passed this. I read the letter out loud to my son. When this first started happening, I wanted to be empathetic, but now I’m just upset. I really think he does this for 2 reasons: 1. He doesn’t know how to react to discipline/it makes him uncomfortable and 2. Attention-seeking. I told him that he only needs to say 2 things when he gets in trouble: 1. I’m sorry and 2. Yes, ma’am/sir. That’s it. My husband threatened to take him out of summer camp.

I’ll be honest that I didn’t like discipline growing up and would often feel like curling up into a ball. But to hit myself or threaten harm to myself? I have a hard time empathizing with that. I’m hoping this is the last time I have to deal with this, but if it isn’t, I’d like to know how I should react next time it might happen.

Does anyone have experience with this? Suggestions?"
852,t3_4o2w8l,sarcazm,"If we pulled him out of camp, he would most likely go to a daycare because we both work. It was an idle threat because this camp is cheaper than daycare and I would only pull him in the most dire of circumstances.

I don't mind him expressing emotions. That being said, we all have to learn how to take criticism and follow teacher instructions. I would like a solution where my son would be able to say ""yes ma'am"" to a teacher in the moment. He can feel how he wants about whatever but I doubt hitting your head on a table is a healthy way to express that emotion. I feel like he's too old to be acting like a toddler when he gets in trouble and too young to feel like he should be threatening suicide over something like someone telling him to be quiet during a lesson. 

I think my best bet is to suggest ways to have an outlet without harming yourself. Other people in this thread have suggested some things I may try. ",2,"So, basically what the title says. This started at home and has made its way into public school and summer camp.
